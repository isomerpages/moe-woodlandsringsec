### **July**
##### **Racial Harmony Day**
Our students celebrated Racial Harmony Day by engaging in various activities such as ketupat making, face mask painting, how to pull teh-tarik and making prata. It was a day where everyone could learn more about other races and learn how to interact positively and not take what we have for granted.
