### **June**
##### **WRS20!**
Woodlands Ring Secondary School celebrated 20 years of existence with a carnival involving all our staff and students. It was a day of fun as we had time to connect with alumni, parents and all our friends from the neighbourhood. Here’s to more years of cultivating Responsible, Respectful and Resilient leaders!
