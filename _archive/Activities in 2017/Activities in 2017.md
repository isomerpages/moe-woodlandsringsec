The WRS Student Experience is truly an enriching one as the year is jam packed with exciting, student-centric activities that aim to develop students into all-rounded individuals who will be fully prepared for the increasingly vibrant yet volatile future.

The school firmly believes that character education is the cornerstone of an all-embracing education. Key school programmes with clear learning outcomes enable students to become engaged learners, persons of good character and responsible citizens. We aim to engage the minds and encourage the hearts of students through hands-on meaningful learning tasks in and beyond school.

Students engage in meaningfully designed activities that are guided by the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) framework of 21st Century Competencies, where every WRS student is an ACTIVE CITIZEN and VIBRANT LEADER.

At Lower Secondary, activities focus on enabling students to develop essential Social and Emotional Competencies in the inner ring of the framework – skills necessary for our students manage their emotions, develop care and concern for others and establish positive relationships with others as they transition into the secondary school experience. Other than through Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) lessons, students acquire these skills from inter-class competitions during Chinese New Year, Sports Day, National Day and the exciting Experiential Learning Week (Week X).

At Upper Secondary, students are challenged more cognitively to acquire skills in the outer ring to better prepare them for post-secondary education and the globalised world. Students are empowered to initiate and plan whole school events such as the ‘Secondary One Orientation’, ‘Total Defence Day Commemoration’ and ‘Racial Harmony Day’. Not only that, Secondary Three students in the Normal Technical Course of study are given the opportunity to plan ‘Technically Normal Day’, a highly anticipated annual talent showcase.

The WRS Experience is truly built on the philosophy that each student is unique and whose potential can be maximised so as to contribute selflessly to society.

**We look forward to the vibrant activities lined up for the year!**
