### **Community Youth Leadership**
**Student Leadership development through Community involvement**
Our school is committed to the philosophy that each student possesses unique abilities and has the potential to contribute to society in a meaningful way. With this in mind, our school's Learning for Life Programme (LLP) focuses on developing leadership competencies for all students. Our goal is to foster active, contributive, and caring individuals who can make a positive impact on their community.
To guide our approach, we draw upon The Leadership Challenge (TLC) model by Kouzes and Posner, which emphasises that leadership is a set of observable skills and abilities that can be learned and practiced by anyone. 
Our programme is designed to be age-appropriate and progressive, catering to the developmental needs of our students. It consists of two tiers: 
- Tier 1, offered to all students to reinforce the learning and application of baseline competencies for Student Leadership, and 
- Tier 2, specifically tailored for Student Leaders to deepen studentsâ€™ leadership competencies

**Tier 1 - Baseline Leadership Development**
The five Practices of TLC are introduced at various stages during students' secondary school years. The first practice, Model the Way, is taught in Secondary 1. It empowers students to discover their own voice by clarifying their values and aligning their actions with shared values. This emphasises the importance of self-leadership and sets a positive tone for others to follow. Overall, it lays a solid foundation for developing leadership skills in students throughout their secondary school journey.
