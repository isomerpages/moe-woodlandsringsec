### **Learning for Life Programme**
##### **Student Leadership Development through involvement in the Community Programme**
In WRS, we believe that every student is unique and whose potential can be maximised so as to contribute selflessly to society. Each student can certainly be a good leader of himself or herself first, before stepping forward to serve others. As such, our school’s Learning for Life Programme focusses on Student Leadership Development through involvement in the Community.

As one walks along the corridors of the Lower Secondary blocks on Fridays, one will be greeted by scenes of students, engaged in games and activities. Through the deliberate activities, students learn more about themselves, discovering their strengths and limitations. They pick up useful skills while working with others – the importance of trust and support within a team, valuing that every single person’s contribution is important for a team’s success. These leadership behaviours are modelled on The Leadership Challenge Framework, a framework which the school adopts for its development of student leaders.

Where will students demonstrate the application of these acquired skills? In Secondary 1, students apply the skills as they work together to identify and take ownership of an area in the school, in support of the ‘Keep Singapore Clean’ movement. In Secondary 2, students are tasked to design games to create more awareness of environmental issues. They also plan how these games will be showcased during the Green Carnival at the end of the year. These platforms offer students authentic settings that challenge them to grow and develop their competencies to become confident leaders with effective communication skills.

In addition, the LLP provides a good opportunity for teachers to interact with students in an informal setting, thus strengthening the teacher-student relationship. Teachers’ facilitation skills are enhanced as they serve as facilitators during the lessons conducted in the LLP.
