### **Science**
##### **Department Programmes / Highlights**<br><br>**The WRS Science Experience**

WRS seeks to provide opportunities for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies, particularly in Communication, Collaboration and Information skills, as well as Critical and Inventive Thinking.

The following are some platforms designed to engage students in scientific inquiry.

**(1) School-wide programmes**<br>
All students are engaged in the assembly programmes that showcase science demonstrations and provides opportunities for students to apply their scientific concepts to explain daily phenomena.

**(2) Level-wide programmes**<br>
All Secondary 1 to 3 students are engaged in scientific investigation and /or research projects which aims to develop critical and inventive thinking, collaboration and communication skills. Students are engaged in collaborative projects to investigate phenomena, analyse data and present their findings.

**(3) Talent Development programme**<br>
The department also believes in providing opportunities for students with an aptitude for the subject to immerse themselves in scientific research and real-world applications of Science to foster their love for the subject. Through our Talent Development programme (TDP), students develop 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, and communication, collaboration and information skills.

In 2022 (Term 1), Sec 1 Science TDP students participated in the Cardboard Challenge activity. Each group of students was required to create a chair using only carboard without any types of adhesive material (e.g., glue, tape).

#### Electronics ####

Electronics is offered as an O-Level subject in our school. This subject aims to provide students with an understanding of the fundamental working of electronic components and systems, as well as engineering design process. It provides a broad-based foundation for further studies in electronics, engineering and related fields.

Students will have hands-on practical to understand circuits and their functionality. Students not only build prototype circuits but also use computer simulation software to investigate and verify their designs.  

Through coursework projects, students are exposed to engineering design that requires troubleshooting and problem-solving skills. Such exposure enables students to apply the acquired knowledge in an authentic context that allows students to integrate and link what they have learnt across different topics.

#### Mobile Robotics ####

Mobile Robotics is offered to Upper Secondary School Normal Technical students in our school.  It focuses on the design, construction, and control of mobile robots. The subject provides students with hands-on experience in building their own robots and lays the foundation for further studies in the field of mechatronics engineering or related fields.

Students will learn the basics of electronics and robot design, as well as develop problem-solving and critical thinking skills through hands-on projects and activities. The subject also covers the impact of automated technology on society and its changing nature. It provides students with the essential knowledge and skills that can be useful in pursuing further studies in the field of Robotics.

In 2022, selected Mobile Robotics students from the inaugural Mobile Robotics Talent Programme participated in two competitions, namely the ITE Ignite Challenge and the National Robotics Competition. Students built and coded mobile robots with sensors and actuators to solve problems for authentic tasks such as rescue missions. They had also demonstrated and communicated their ideas and learnings to external judges. As a result of their efforts, they clinched the following awards:
- 3rd Prize for the Sense Time Autonomous Challenge (ITE Ignite)
- Judges Award (Most Futuristic Robot) (National Robotics Competition)

At WRS, Biology lessons are not restricted to classroom learning! We challenge our students to apply their understanding of biological concepts through the creation of their own plant cell models (using jelly and candies) and engaging hands-on activities such as dissection of sheep hearts. We too, would like our students to experience what life is like working in a biology/medical laboratory by getting them to apply practical skills to determine medical conditions/ diseases through simple biological tests.

Secondary 1 students start their scientific endeavour at WRS by **investigating the absorbency of baby diapers**.

They plan and design their own experiments to test their hypothesis of the most absorbent diaper brand.

WRS is one of 14 schools in Singapore that offers **Mobile Robotics** to students from the Normal (Technical) course of study.

Here, our Mobile Robotics students explore, design and build electronic systems and mobile robots to solve authentic problems. Through learning by doing, students are able to develop core skills in electronics and appreciate the importance of robotics in the industry. Most importantly, they have fun in the process!

Woodlands Ring Secondary is one of nine schools in Singapore that offers **Electronics at O-Level**.

Typically, students learn Electronics by building simple hardware circuits to verify what they have learnt in theory.

At WRS, besides hardware, Electronics students use computer software to simulate more complex electronics systems before learning the theory, by using tools in the software. This helps them become more skilled at using the industry-standard computer software.
