##### **Department Programmes / Highlights**<br><br>**The WRS Science Experience**

WRS seeks to provide opportunities for students to acquire 21st Century Competencies, particularly in Communication, Collaboration and Information skills, as well as Critical and Inventive Thinking.

The following are some platforms designed to engage students in scientific inquiry.

**(1) School-wide programme**<br>
All students are engaged in the assembly programmes that showcase science demonstrations and provides opportunities for students to apply their scientific concepts to explain daily phenomena.

**(2) Level-wide programme**<br>
All Secondary 1 to 3 students are engaged in scientific investigation and /or research projects which aims to develop critical and inventive thinking, collaboration and communication skills. Students are engaged in collaborative projects to investigate phenomena, analyse data and present their findings.

**(3) Talent Development programme**<br>
In 2022 (Term 1), Sec 1 Science TDP students participated in the Cardboard 

Challenge activity. Each group of students was required to create a chair using only carboard without any types of adhesive material (e.g., glue, tape

At WRS, Biology lessons are not restricted to classroom learning! We challenge our students to apply their understanding of biological concepts through the creation of their own plant cell models (using jelly and candies) and engaging hands-on activities such as dissection of sheep hearts. We too, would like our students to experience what life is like working in a biology/medical laboratory by getting them to apply practical skills to determine medical conditions/ diseases through simple biological tests.

Secondary 1 students start their scientific endeavour at WRS by **investigating the absorbency of baby diapers**.

They plan and design their own experiments to test their hypothesis of the most absorbent diaper brand.

WRS is one of 14 schools in Singapore that offers **Mobile Robotics** to students from the Normal (Technical) course of study.

Here, our Mobile Robotics students explore, design and build electronic systems and mobile robots to solve authentic problems. Through learning by doing, students are able to develop core skills in electronics and appreciate the importance of robotics in the industry. Most importantly, they have fun in the process!

##### **N**URTURES talent

At WRS, the **Science Talent Development Programme** provides a wide range of opportunities designed to enable individual students to discover, pursue and nurture their own aspirations and talents. It caters to students’ varying abilities, strengths, talents and interests, and provides breadth and depth in their journey of learning and self-discovery.
