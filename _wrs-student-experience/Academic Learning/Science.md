### **Science**
##### **Department Programmes / Highlights**<br><br>**The WRS Science Experience**

In line with the Science Curriculum Framework, WRS aims to develop our students to be critical thinkers, inquisitive and innovative learners.

In addition to the national curriculum, the following are some platforms designed to engage students in scientific inquiry.

**(1) Level-wide programmes**<br>
All Secondary 1 to 3 students are engaged in scientific investigation and /or research projects which aims to develop critical and inventive thinking, collaboration and communication skills. Students are engaged in collaborative projects to investigate phenomena, analyse data and present their findings.  

**(2) Talent Development programmes**<br>
The department also believes in providing opportunities for students with an aptitude for the subject to immerse themselves in scientific research and real-world applications of Science to foster their love for the subject. Through our Talent Development programme (TDP), students develop 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, and communication, collaboration and information skills. 

Students are given opportunities to attend enrichment workshops and participate in science competitions such as International Elementz Science Project Competitions, Science Buskers Festival, National Digital Explorer, International C.B. Paul Science Quiz, Singapore Junior Biology, Chemistry and Physics Olympiads

#### Electronics ###
Electronics is offered as an O-Level subject in our school. This subject aims to provide students with an understanding of the fundamental working of electronic components and systems, as well as engineering design process. It provides a broad-based foundation for further studies in electronics, engineering and related fields.

Students will have hands-on practical to understand circuits and their functionality. Students not only build prototype circuits but also use computer simulation software to investigate and verify their designs.  

Through coursework projects, students are exposed to engineering design that requires troubleshooting and problem-solving skills. Such exposure enables students to apply the acquired knowledge in an authentic context that allows students to integrate and link what they have learnt across different topics.

#### Mobile Robotics: Nurturing Future Engineers ####
**Introduction** <br>
The Mobile Robotics programme equips Upper Secondary School Normal Technical students with the hands-on skills and theoretical knowledge to design, build, and control their own mobile robots. This program provides a strong foundation for further studies in Mechatronics Engineering and related fields.

**Curriculum**<br>
•	Fundamentals: Students gain in-depth understanding of electronics, mechanics, and programming, enabling them to translate theory into tangible robotic creations.<br>
•	Problem-Solving Skills: Through engaging projects and activities, students develop critical thinking, logic, and decision-making skills as they navigate robots through challenges and scenarios.<br>
 •	Technological Awareness: This program explores the impact of automated technology on society, preparing students for a future where robots play an increasingly significant role.
 

**Achievements**<br>
Our Mobile Robotics Talent Programme students have consistently demonstrated their skills and creativity in competitive events:<br>
•	2022: 3rd Prize in the Sense Time Autonomous Challenge (ITE Ignite) and Judges Award for Most Futuristic Robot (National Robotics Competition).<br>
•	2023: 2nd Prize in the Mobile Robot Challenge (ITE Ignite).
