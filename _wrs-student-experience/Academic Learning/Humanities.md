##### **Programmes**
We believe in offering our students an experiential and authentic learning of Humanities. Besides organising learning journeys to complement the curriculum, the department also leverages external platforms such as competitions and conferences. Through these experiences, the department hopes to help our students make meaning of what they have learned and nurture their love for the Humanities.

To promote student engagement and make Humanities learning relevant, we bring students on learning journey to various locations; we embark on an open-top bus tour to discover historical sights of our city, we visit the Pulau Semakau Landfill to enhance their environmental awareness, &nbsp;and we conduct ‘Behind the Scene’ educational tour of local retailers to expose students to authenthic business operations and marketing strategies.

As part of our effort to cultivate the joy of learning and build the 21st Century competencies such as critical thinking and collaboration skills, our students also took part in&nbsp;the Model UN Conference, recognised for its broad coverage and quality discussions of&nbsp;global&nbsp;topics. We also actively participated in the Historical Scene Investigation Challenge, Student Archivist Project and the National Youth Environmental Conference (NYEC). Our student teams have accredited themselves well in the respective categories of these competitions.

**Week X Secondary 1 History Learning Journey – Singapore River Heritage Trail**
![](/images/Week_X_pic_1.jpg)
During Week X, our Secondary One students explored the Civic District to learn more about our history. Starting with Raffles’ landing point at Empress Place, our young historians walked along the Singapore River bank to identify key buildings and structures that were integral to our development as a trading port.

They then ended their walking trail with a cruise onboard the iconic bumboat. As the bumboat glided through the waters, the young historians admired the iconic landmarks, learning about the river's important role in the early days of Singapore. This learning journey experience has enabled our students to connect to our city’s past.

Our Secondary Two students headed to the National Museum of Singapore to take part in the ‘Artefactually Speaking’ programme.

In this artefact-centric programme that was co-developed with the Ministry of Education, our students were given the autonomy to explore the galleries independently. Guided by a Passport activity booklet, students decided on the exhibits to visit based on their interests. They also discovered fascinating stories about specific artefacts from Singapore’s 700 years of history as they interacted with the Museum Educators.
