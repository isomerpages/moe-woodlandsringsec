### **Physical Education**
#####  **Department Programmes / Highlights**

The WRS Physical Education Department aims to develop every student such that he is able to demonstrate individually and with others the physical skills, practices and values to enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living. Through the PE lessons, the teachers hope to equip the students with the confidence and positive attitudes necessary to transit from the physical education setting to participation in physical activity in adulthood.

The three learning areas of Physical Activity, Outdoor Education, and Physical Health and Safety are pivotal in providing the content for design and enactment of studentsâ€™ meaningful learning experiences in, about and through movement.

Learning experiences in movement develops movement competency which is essential to life, work and play. It also facilitates participation and enables the students to derive pleasure and satisfaction from physical activities. Students in WRS can expect to learn a wide variety of physical activities such as sports and games from the different game categories, track and field events and dance.

Learning experiences through movement not only allows students to reap physical benefits, but also equip them with an extensive knowledge base to transfer the learning to other settings, such as outside of school or in their studies. Because of the competitive and collaborative activities carefully planned out, every PE lesson in WRS is an authentic setting for students to develop and practise the 21st Century Competencies, the school values and other ideals that support the development of good character.

Learning experiences about movement addresses the value and benefits of a healthy lifestyle and a fit body. The students are taught how to be engaged in safe physical activities. As part of self-directed learning in WRS, they are also given the opportunity to monitor their physical fitness status and learn what they can do to contribute towards good health.

The Department is highly committed to providing the students with meaningful learning experiences through quality instructions and purposeful assessment. With strong support from the Ministry of Education and the school, the department is not far from achieving its goal.
