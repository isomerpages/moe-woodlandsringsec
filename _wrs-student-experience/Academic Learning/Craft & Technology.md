In addition, D&T students’ learning experience is enhanced through the following programmes and activities which we organise for the year:

* Learning Journey (e.g. IKEA, Museums, Design Singapore Council)  
* WRS Design Platforms  
* 3D Modelling through Computer Aided Design  
* NYP Building Design Skills  
* RP 3D Printing Challenge

##### **FCE Lower Secondary Curriculum**

The FCE syllabus is designed to empower students to be health-conscious and discerning consumers, enabling them to better manage their lives for the present and future. We focus on equipping students with 21st Century Competencies in order to guide them into becoming confident, self-directed learners who practice responsible decision-making. These skills are important in preparing students to live in a world marked by changing lifestyles, globalization and consumer patterns. FCE is a relevant subject teaches students how to optimise their resources of food, finance and time to meet their physical, mental, social and economic needs.

Learning programmes:  
* Coursework project focussed on Food Culture  
* Performance Task focussed on Food Presentation  
* Online learning platforms (e.g. Google Classroom)

##### **F&N Upper Secondary Curriculum**

Nutrition and Food Science (NFS) is an elective subject offered to students at the Upper Secondary levels. It is an extension of the Lower Secondary subject, Food and Consumer Education (FCE). NFS helps to develop students’ understanding of concepts related to nutrition and meal planning which is helpful to them as well as others whom they can advise. It also focusses on developing their understanding of principles of food science and ultimately understanding the link between diet and health.

Through our programmes, we aim to equip our students with 21st Century Competencies like Decision Making, being a Self-directed Learner and an Active Contributor. In addition, NFS students’ learning experience is enhanced through the following which we organise for the year:

* APS Fusion Fiesta ‘Local Flavours’ Baking Competition.  
* ITE Ignite Challenge
