#### We achieve our goals through the following platforms: 
##### 1. Level-Wide Programmes

From Secondary One through Secondary Three, our students participate in a variety of activities designed to bolster their informational, collaborative, and communication skills. Here's how we do it:

* **Secondary 1:** Students focus on communicating effectively, enhancing their ability to articulate ideas clearly and confidently.

Across all levels, we leverage technology to acquire and apply New Media Literacy (NML) skills in their research and creation of podcasts, vodcasts and presentation slides.  

##### 2. Talent Development Programme
Our commitment to nurturing a love for the English Language and Literature is evident through our Talent Development Programme. These include:

* **Workshops and Seminars:** Tailored sessions to refine students' writing, reading, and speaking skills.

* **School-based Competitions:** Opportunities such as inter-class debates, public speaking contests, poetry slams, drama showcases, and flash fiction writing encourage students to apply their skills in competitive and creative settings. We support and encourage our students to participate in various competitions, including *National Schools Literature Festival, Live On Festival Design &amp; Essay Competitions, Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA), HIPPO English Olympiad, Marshall Cavendish Global Writing Competition and The Queen's Commonwealth Essay Competition.*
