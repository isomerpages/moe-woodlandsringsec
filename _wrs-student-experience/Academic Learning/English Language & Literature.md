### **English Language and Literature**
#### **Department Programmes / Highlights**
In line with the department’s vision of getting our students to be confident users of the English Language, we have several key programmes and strategies to support our vision.

#### **Whole school approach to reading**

At WRSS, we believe in inculcating a lifelong reading habit among our<br> students and for the students to enjoy reading. The importance of<br> reading a wide repertoire of books across different genres is also essential.<br> As such, we use various platforms to promote the importance of reading. <br>Among them are :

*   **Appointment of Reading Ambassadors** **(RA)**

Students are appointed as RAs and receive training on how to pass on the passion for reading to their friends. They also have the opportunity to take part in competitions like the Kids Lit Quiz National Storytelling Challenge as well as National Schools Literature Festival to further hone their passion for reading and the English Language as a whole.

*   **Our RAs take part in the following competitions annually**
