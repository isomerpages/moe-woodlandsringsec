#### **About the CCA**

The NCC Syllabus is gradual and progressive. It aims to provide a diverse range of challenging and enriching activities. The five broad objectives of our activities are **Character Building, National Education, Adventurous Spirit, Leadership and Military Awareness.**

NCC is guided by** 3 key thrusts** – Leadership, Fitness and Commitment to Singapore and is driven by 8 core values – Loyalty to Country, Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline, Commitment & Responsibility, Care for Fellow Cadets, Adventurous Spirit and Safety.

NCC has a Leadership Competency Model (LCM) that ensures cadets are equipped with sound leadership skills at the end of 4 to 5 years.

During their 1st year, the cadets learn basic military knowledge and skills such as the history and role of SAF and NCC, Footdrills, SAR 21 weapon handling, Individual Field Craft (IFC) and Orienteering. They are initiated into NCC through the HQ’s Affirmation Ceremony and our unit’s Camp VALUES where they get to visit the Singapore Army Museum. NCC HQ also organises Camp FORGE to build confidence in the cadets through adventure elements.

During their 2nd year, the cadets will deepen their knowledge of the military skills they have learnt in the 1st year. Besides more advanced drills, IFC and Orienteering, they are also introduced to the fundamentals of shooting through an Air Rifle Shooting program organised by NCC HQ. In addition, they will attend another adventure camp called Camp STEEL which focuses on the value of teamwork. Cadets will also learn life skills and build up their ruggedness through other adventure activities such as the Unit Hike and the 1-Star Kayaking Course.

During their 3rd and 4th / 5th year, the cadets will be given the opportunity to lead, plan and execute training programmes. The aim is to allow the cadets to pick up leadership skills under the guidance of teacher officers. To ensure that the cadets can impart the necessary military knowledge confidently, NCC conducts Specialist Assessment in which they earn the rank of third sergeant and the Army-NCC badge. Outstanding cadets will attend the Senior Specialist Leaders Course and they can look forward to becoming key appointment holders in the school’s NCC unit. In addition, cadets hone their SAR21 marksmanship in the Individual Marksmanship Training and Live Shooting program organised by NCC HQ.

All cadets have the option to learn Freestyle Drill and Precision Drill movements which build teamwork and resilience. Besides having a chance to participate in Freestyle Drill Competition and Precision Drill Squad Competition, cadets also perform at school-based events such as Total Defence Day Commemoration and National Day Celebration.

In line with the school’s strategic thrust of Character Excellence, the NCC unit also embarks on meaningful service-learning project each year to inculcate in cadets, a sense of responsibility to their immediate community, and to enable them to understand that they too can become active contributors to their society.
