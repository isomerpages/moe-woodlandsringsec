#### **About the CCA**

National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) is a National Uniformed Group under the purview of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Our School’s NCDCC was established in 2019 with the aim of promoting awareness and emergency preparedness amongst students with regard to fire-fighting, rescue as well rendering effective first-aid among others. NCDCC believes in developing and empowering youths to be active and concerned citizens advocating life-saving skills. 

Cadets will be equipped with the practical skills which are critical in the face of danger and emergencies and be nurtured with the attitude of readiness against adversity.

NCDCC is strongly supported by the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) in terms of logistics, as well as providing relevant and quality training to our cadets. Thus, we hope to instil the spirit of civic-mindedness as well as to carry on the proud tradition of civil defence among our youths.

**Secondary 1**
Cadets are provided with basic training such as foot drill and fire safety. They are also trained in first-aid, fire-fighting and campcraft. In addition, they are strongly encouraged to participate in courses such as kayaking and self-defence to boost confidence. 

The three badges that a Secondary One Cadets will need to complete include Total Defence (Bronze), Foot Drill (Bronze) and Fire Safety Proficiency. They are eligible for promotion to Lance Corporal upon completion of the three badge works.

**Secondary 2**
Cadets are given more opportunities to participate in various activities and competitions such as CPR-AED course, Precision Drill Challenge and UACDC. Promising cadets are also sent to attend certain workshops that train them to be effective leaders who are capable of guiding the junior cadets. 

Secondary Two Cadets typically will complete six badges within the year. These include Civil Defence Knowledge, First Aid Proficiency, SANA, Foot Drill (Silver), CPR+AED Proficiency and Rescue Proficiency. They are eligible for promotion to Sergeant upon completion of six badge works.

**Secondary 3**
At this level, the cadets are given more responsibilities to lead the whole unit. They will undergo a Specialisation course and upon successful completion of the course, they will be promoted to Staff Sergeant. Secondary Three Cadets are also required to complete the HAZMAT Proficiency and Homefront Security Badges. Top Tier cadets can be shortlisted to attend Foot Drill Gold Assessment, the Unit Drill Instructor Course, and represent in SCDF parade as well as an Overseas Educational Visit.

* Fire Safety

**Secondary 4**
Senior leaders will mentor their junior leaders and guide them in their training programme. Cadet Leaders who have demonstrated exemplary performance and are inspiring role models will be promoted to the rank of Warrant Officers (WO). Cadets will also be attending Psychological First Aid Course.
