#### **About the CCA**

Passion. Drive. Determination. These are the three values behind the success of the CCA, entering its eighteenth year. As part of the Hypernova Family, WRS Hockey is a vibrant family consisting of disciplined players and nurturing teacher mentors. 

The Hockey CCA believes in inculcating a culture of discipline and unity within the team. Hence, emphasis is given to building team work and inspiring a shared vision amongst all members of the CCA. Through regular trainings on our own Hockey Multi-Purpose Court (MPC), pitch training sessions at various hockey facilities in Singapore, friendlies with other schools and physical training sessions, our players are well-prepared to represent the CCA in the annual National Schools Tournament and the various Hockey Leagues. 

The success of the CCA is led by a team of nurturing and dedicated teachers who journey together with the boys towards being gentlemen out of the game and warriors on the pitch. Together with former National Hockey player and former U14 Assistant Head Coach Farhan Kamsani, the boys are pushed and motivated towards breaking new ground. The active involvement of our alumni and parents is instrumental in making all our participation in the various leagues and tournaments possible. 

As a values-driven CCA, WRS Hockey players are student-athletes. They aspire towards being exemplary in behaviour, studies and attitude. The key belief: The strength of the wolf is the pack, the strength of the pack is the wolf.
