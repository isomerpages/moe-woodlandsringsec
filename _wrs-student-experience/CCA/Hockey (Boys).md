<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Passion. Drive. Determination. These are the three values behind the success
of the CCA, entering its tenth year. As part of the Hypernova Family, WRS
Hockey is a vibrant family consisting of disciplined players and nurturing
teacher mentors.</p>
<p>The Hockey CCA believes in inculcating a culture of discipline and unity
within the team. Hence, emphasis is given to building team work and inspiring
a shared vision amongst all members of the CCA. Through regular trainings
on our own Hockey Multi-Purpose Court (MPC), pitch training sessions at
various hockey facilities in Singapore, friendlies with other schools and
physical training sessions, our players are well-prepared to represent
the CCA in the annual National Schools Tournament and the various Hockey
Leagues.</p>
<p>The success of the CCA is led by a team of nurturing and dedicated teachers
who journey together with the boys towards being gentlemen out of the game
and warriors on the pitch. Together with former National Hockey player,
Coach Farhan Kamsani, the boys are pushed and motivated towards breaking
new ground. The active involvement of our alumni and parents is instrumental
in making all our participation in the various leagues and tournaments
possible.</p>
<p>As a value-driven CCA, WRS Hockey players are student-athletes. They aspire
towards being exemplary in behaviour, studies and attitude. The key belief:
The strength of the wolf is the pack, the strength of the pack is the wolf.</p>
