One of these examinations is offered by NTU and The TENG Company. The cost incurred for the examination and music scores are to be paid for by students. More information can be found on the website: https://www.thetengcompany.com/grading-home](https://www.thetengcompany.com/grading-home)

**Learning Journey and External Performances**
Learning Journey is one way to expose our students to music in every form, and to learn from professionals. Transport may not be provided for all journeys, so as to give students opportunities to practice responsibility.

In an effort to provide more opportunities for students to perform, students may be brought out for performances at various venues. Two-way transportation will be provided.

**Targeted Student Profile**

* Students who are interested in learning a musical instrument. Prior experience in playing a musical instrument is not required.
* Some would be selected to learn percussion instruments such as the drums and timpani.
* Students who have foundation in music (e.g. piano, violin) would find their prior knowledge and training an advantage when learning the Guzheng or percussion instruments.

 **Target number of students*

10 students
