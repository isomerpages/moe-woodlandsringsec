#### **About the CCA**

The English Drama Club, or EC for short, provides students with a platform for sharing ideas and dreams that they might not otherwise have the means to express. Students can explore new roles and experiment with different personas, gaining new insights and perspectives through fun and creative activities. Together, they collaborate to improvise and make the script come alive. Opportunities, not only limited to acting, are also provided to prepare students to take up different roles and responsibilities such as stage manager, costume and prop designer, multimedia technician, etc. As such, we cultivate a group of drama enthusiasts who confidently share their love and passion for the art form with the school and the community. 

Within a safe environment, the EC family work together and support one another to continue the unique spirit of the CCA through our signature shout-out ‘All Hail EC!’
