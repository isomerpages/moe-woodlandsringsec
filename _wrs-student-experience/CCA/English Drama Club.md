<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The English Drama Club, or EC for short, provides students with a platform
for sharing ideas and dreams that they might not otherwise have the means
to express. Students can explore new roles and experiment with different
personas, gaining new insights and perspectives through fun and creative
activities. Together, they collaborate to improvise and make the script
come alive. Opportunities, not only limited to acting, are also provided
to prepare students to take up different roles and responsibilities such
as stage manager, costume and prop designer, multimedia technician, etc.
As such, we cultivate a group of drama enthusiasts who confidently share
their love and passion for the art form with the school and the community.</p>
<p>Within a safe environment, the EC family work together and support one
another to continue the unique spirit of the CCA through our signature
shout-out ‘All Hail EC!’</p>
