#### **About the CCA**

The Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) in Woodlands Ring Secondary School commenced in 2022.

The aims of the Club are (i) to raise awareness of aviation knowledge amongst members and (ii) to inculcate a strong passion for flying among youths. In line with our school philosophy of recognising each student as unique and whose potential can be maximised, SYFC serves to help members develop their fullest potential.

There will be hands-on and on-site experiences in terms of building and launching gliders. In addition, members will learn to control powered model aircraft flying in the aeromodelling world besides learning to code and fly drones including FPV drones. Those who aspire to earn their own Private Pilot License (PPL) can also begin with the PC Flight Simulator which introduces members to the basics of piloting a light aircraft. At greater heights, eligible members will be able to attend short flying courses at Seletar Airport leading to attaining the PPL. Unique to this CCA, members will have the chance to go on Flight Experience Programme on different types of aircraft, both civilian and military.

SYFC members will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills by participating in a number of competitions. It also allows our members time for purposeful exploration, self-reflection, thinking out-of-the-box to create innovative inventions, sharing their passion and love for aviation with members from other local and international schools as part of the outreach programme, including global classroom experience, and empower them to achieve excellence.
