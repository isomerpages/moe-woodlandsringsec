<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Singapore Youth Flying Club (SYFC) in Woodlands Ring Secondary School
commenced in 2022.</p>
<p>The aims of the Club are (i) to raise awareness of aviation knowledge
amongst members and (ii) to inculcate a strong passion for flying among
youths. In line with our school philosophy of recognising each student
as unique and whose potential can be maximised, SYFC serves to help members
develop their fullest potential.</p>
<p>There will be hands-on and on-site experiences in terms of building and
launching gliders. In addition, members will learn to control powered model
aircraft flying in the aeromodelling world besides learning to code and
fly drones including FPV drones. Those who aspire to earn their own Private
Pilot License (PPL) can also begin with Flight Simulation to build experience
in flying, leading to Flight Simulator training, which introduces members
to the basics of piloting a light aircraft. Those who like Remote-Controlled
planes can have a go at Electric Control Line flying and qualify for international
competitions held at Indonesia and/or Australia. At greater heights, eligible
members will be able to attend short flying courses at Seletar Airport
leading to attaining the PPL. Unique to this CCA, members will have the
chance to go on Flight Experience Programme (FEP) on different types of
aircraft, both civilian and military.</p>
<p>SYFC members will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge and skills
by participating in a number of competitions. It also allows our members
time for purposeful exploration, self-reflection, thinking out-of-the-box
to create innovative inventions, sharing their passion and love for aviation
with members from other local and international schools as part of the
outreach programme, including global classroom experience, and empower
them to achieve excellence.</p>
