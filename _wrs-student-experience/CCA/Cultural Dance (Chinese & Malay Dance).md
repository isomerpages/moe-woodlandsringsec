<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Cultural Dance CCA in WRSS focusses on providing students with a strong
foundation in traditional dances that reflect the cultural heritage of
various ethnic groups. The CCA&nbsp; programmes are designed to preserve
and promote cultural traditions through dance while encouraging students
to develop discipline, teamwork, and an appreciation for the arts.</p>
<p>The CCA comprises of the Chinese Cultural Dance and Malay Cultural Dance
groups. While the respective Cultural Dance groups have independent and
targeted programmes for their CCA members, they actively seek opportunities
to collaborate so as to provide dancers with exposure to inter-cultural
dance skills, knowledge and techniques.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2022 was the inaugural year in which Chinese and Malay Dances collaborated
in presenting a fusion dance item during the School’s National Day concert
and at Kampung Admiralty. Since then, the CCA has provided students with
several opportunities to put up stage performances, as well as pick up
interpersonal and cross-cultural communication and leadership skills.</p>
<p><strong>Our CCA sessions are guided by the following outcomes:&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Skill Development</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Physical Coordination: Students learn complex movements and sequences,
enhancing their balance, rhythm, and agility.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cultural Understanding: Students gain insights into the history, symbolism,
and cultural significance of the dances they perform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Confidence and Expression: Through performance opportunities, students
build self-confidence and learn to express themselves creatively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Events and Performances</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The CCA often culminates in performances at school events, cultural festivals,
or even national competitions. These performances enable students to showcase
their skills and celebrate their cultural heritage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teamwork and Discipline</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Students work closely with one another to perfect their routines, learning
the importance of timing, synchronisation, and collaboration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students are selected and groomed to become confident leaders who are
able to lead their CCA effectively.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the guidance of the dance instructors, Miss Zhang Xiaoqi (Chinese
Dance), Mr Muhammad Rizal (Malay Dance) and the teachers, members have
honed their skills in both Chinese and Malay Dances and conscientiously
apply the school values of <strong>R</strong>esponsibility, <strong>R</strong>espect
and <strong>R</strong>esilience.</p>
