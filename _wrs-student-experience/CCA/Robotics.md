| **About the CCA** | : | The school formed the Robotics Club in 2002 with a very humble beginning comprising only 1 teacher and 4 members. Presently, the Robotics Club is helmed by 6 teachers and has over 120 members. Robotics Club provides varied learning-cum-opportunities for members to excel in and to represent the school at national robotics competitions. Our robotics activities complement the development of declarative and procedural knowledge, computing and technical skills as well as honing abilities which, as a whole, encourage our members to make informed and responsible choices that will enable them to problem-solve and overcome challenges to face the realities of life. In the process, this encourages them to think critically, be inventive and then act upon responsibly. It allows students time for purposeful exploration, self-reflection and empower them to pursue excellence.<br><br>Our Robotics Club serves to identify and train passionate members with inquiring minds and resilience for challenges in robotics competitions. These competitions allow our members time for purposeful exploration, self-reflection, thinking out-of-the-box to create innovative inventions, sharing their passion and love for robotics with members from other local and international schools as part of the outreach programme, including global classroom experience, and empower them to achieve excellence. |
