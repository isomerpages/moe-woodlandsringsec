<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Robotics Club was established in 2002 with a humble beginning of just
one teacher and four students. Today, it has grown into a vibrant CCA led
by three dedicated teachers and supported by more than 100 enthusiastic
members.</p>
<p>The Robotics Club offers varied and meaningful learning opportunities
that allow our students to excel and represent the school in national competitions.
Through our robotics activities, students develop both declarative and
procedural knowledge, strengthen computing and technical skills, and cultivate
the ability to make informed and responsible choices. These experiences
equip them with the confidence and resilience to problem-solve, overcome
challenges, and navigate real-world situations. Along the way, members
learn to think critically, be inventive, and act responsibly. They are
also given time and space for purposeful exploration, self-reflection,
and the pursuit of excellence.</p>
<p>Our Robotics Club aims to identify and nurture passionate students with
inquiring minds and the resilience needed to take on the challenges of
robotics competitions. These competitions provide a platform for purposeful
exploration, creative problem-solving, and innovative thinking. They also
offer opportunities for students to share their passion for robotics with
peers from both local and international schools, fostering collaboration
and broadening their perspectives. Ultimately, these experiences empower
our members to achieve excellence and grow as confident, forward-thinking
individuals.</p>
