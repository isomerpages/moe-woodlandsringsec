<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Modern Dance at Woodlands Ring Secondary School provides students with
opportunities to grow as dancers and as individuals. Every member is encouraged
to develop confidence, passion and graciousness both on and off stage.</p>
<p>All dancers have opportunities to participate in external performances
and competitions that match their level of skill and dedication. Each year,
members also embark on at least one learning journey to explore different
dance genres and broaden their artistic understanding.</p>
<p>Our CCA places strong emphasis on discipline, teamwork, and resilience.
Dancers work towards shared goals, develop their artistry, and build meaningful
friendships within a vibrant and supportive community. Students who display
leadership potential and care for others are groomed to take on leadership
roles within the group.</p>
<p><strong>Our Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Guided by dedicated and experienced instructors, dancers receive training
in both technical dance skills and essential soft skills such as teamwork,
communication and leadership. Our programme caters to all experience levels
from beginners to advanced dancers, embracing diversity in backgrounds,
styles and aspirations.</p>
<p>Members can look forward to a wide range of enriching activities, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Productions and showcases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Competitions</p>

<p>In recent years, WRSS Modern Dance has performed at community events such
as the <strong>National Day Celebrations at Kampung Admiralty</strong>,
where their performance was warmly received. Our senior members took part
in <strong>‘AMPLIFIED! DanceLab25: Youth Leadership Dance Camp’</strong>,
where they explored dance careers, leadership in dance, and the role of
dance in health and well-being, while gaining deeper appreciation of Singapore’s
dance landscape.</p>
