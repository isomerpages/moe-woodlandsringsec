#### **About the CCA**

Vision – Dancers of Distinction, Growing as One

Mission – Nurturing Confident, Passionate and Gracious Dancers

Values – Tenacity, Love ♥, Resilience

Motto – Dare to Dream. Dare to Inspire. Dare to Dance. 

All members of Modern Dance are given the opportunity to participate in external dance performances and competitions according to their levels of dedication and skill. Every year, the dancers will be able to go on at least one learning journey to learn about the different dance genres. 

Modern Dance focusses on both personal and team achievement through discipline and a common goal. The members are expected to work hard, display resilience and gain fulfillment through improving their dance skills. The dancers also become part of a vibrant community where one can build lasting friendships, work collaboratively, and support each other’s growth. Those who demonstrate leadership potential and a genuine concern for others will be groomed to assume positions of responsibility in the dance group. 

In line with our mission of nurturing confident, passionate and gracious dancers, Woodlands Ring’s Modern Dance CCA aims to challenge our dances to present their best self both on and off-stage. 

In our team, we have talented and dedicated instructors to guide the dancers in their growth: in both hard skills of the artform and soft skills such as teamwork and leadership. Our program is suitable for all skill levels, from beginners to advanced dancers, we embrace diversity in styles and backgrounds, and youths who aspire to be dancers. 

Students who join our CCA, are to expect a range of different experiences from productions, competitions, spectating dances and public performances. We had opportunities to bring the joy of dance to our heartlands through invitations to be in public performance. WRSS Modern Dance performed in the annual National Day Celebrations in Kampung Admiralty, and it was well-received by the community. Modern dancers also attended a performance and seminar showcase entitled ‘Breaking Through 2024: Dance, Technology and New Ways of Presenting Dance and Looking at Shows’, presented by the Ministry of Education Arts Education Branch and National Arts Council (NAC). 

In addition, our senior dance leaders had the opportunity to attend a dance camp entitled ‘AMPLIFIED! DanceLab24: Youth Leadership Dance Camp’, where they discovered more about dance, dance careers, and leadership in the dance context, explored the possibilities of dance in the promotion of fitness, health, and well-being and developed an awareness and appreciation of the local dance industry and institutions.

With this pursuit of excellence and strong camaraderie, Modern Dance also attained a Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for three consecutive years in 2017,  2019, 2021 and 2023.
