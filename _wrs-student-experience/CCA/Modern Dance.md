Dare to Inspire. Dare to Dance.<br>All members of Modern Dance are given the opportunity to participate in external dance performances and competitions according to their levels of dedication and skill. Every year, they will also be able to go on at least one learning journey to learn about the different dance genres.<br>Modern Dance focusses on both personal and team achievements through discipline and a common purpose. The members are expected to work hard, and gain fulfillment through improving their dance skills. They will also learn to work together as a team and experience what it is like to be part of a learning and growing community. Those who demonstrate leadership potential and a genuine concern for others will be groomed to assume positions of responsibility in the dance group.<br>In line with our mission of nurturing confident, passionate and gracious dancers, Modern Dance put up a dance showcase “Dare to Dream” in April 2014 at The Republic Cultural Centre, under the guidance of our very dedicated dance instructor, Ms Stephanie Loh. “Dare to Dream 2” was again produced in August 2018, where it showcased Modern Dancers’ creativity, dance techniques and skills through a repertoire of dance items spanning from K-pop items, ballet to hip-hop and many other possible dance genres. “Dare to Dream 2” also gave every student an opportunity to contribute in the various committees such as Publicity, Ticketing, Props Making and Costumes. The production was fully sold out for two nights, and received positive feedback from the crowd consisting of family, friends and colleagues.<br>Modern dancers also go on learning journeys to learn about different forms of dance. Some examples include Singapore Dance Theatre’s Masterpiece in Motion featuring three ballets of international standards, Onegin: Stuttgart Ballet, Don Quixote @ Esplanade and many more.<br>In 2015, Modern Dance was part of Youth Celebrate!, a large-scale festival for the youth at the Singapore Sports Hub. We also took part in Super 24 Dance Competition in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, along with the other talented performing arts groups in Woodlands Ring, the Modern Dancers performed a captivating strong dance item at the school’s Public Performance in The Republic Cultural Centre. In 2018, they attained a slew of achievements such as coming in top for The Royal Dance-off (TRDO) competition and clinching the Judges and Viewer’s Choice awards for SYF Celebrations. With this pursuit of excellence and strong camaraderie, Modern Dance also attained a Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation in both 2017 and 2019 and 2021 (Group A). In 2020, Modern Dance also performed two pieces for the School’s Production “Memories” to feature memories forged in school through dance. |
