<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Volleyball Girls’ team trains diligently twice weekly during the non-competitive
season, and may have additional sessions during competition period. Team-building
activities, on top of inter-school volleyball tournaments, are also organised
for the holistic development of our players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 2000, the Team has done the school proud in North-Zone Inter-Schools
Volleyball Competition and National Schools Championship. We maintained
the top 4 position in the North Zone from 2001 to 2005, 2008 for ‘C’ Division
and from 2003 to 2007 for ‘B’ Division. The ‘C’ Girls were National 2<sup>nd</sup> Runners-up
and 1<sup>st</sup> Runners-up in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The team achieved
her five-year-goal with two teams in the National Top Eight in 2004.</p>
<p>Our players not only acquire Volleyball playing skills in the sport, but
will also become more resilient by overcoming challenges. With programmes
and activities to develop perseverance and time-management skills, the
majority of our players do well in their academic studies too. Players
are also given ample opportunities to organise inter-class competitions
so as to develop their leadership and organisational skills. A large number
of our Volleyball players have been selected to serve as Class or Student
Leaders, resulting in Excellent grades in CCA records.</p>
