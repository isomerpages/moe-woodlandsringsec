#### **About the CCA**

The Volleyball Girls’ team trains diligently three times a week during the competitive season and twice weekly during the non-competitive season. Team-building activities, on top of inter-school volleyball tournaments, are also organised for the holistic development of our players. 
	
Since 2000, the Team has done the school proud in North-Zone Inter-Schools Volleyball Competition and National Schools Championship. We maintained the top 4 position in the North Zone from 2001 to 2005, 2008 for ‘C’ Division and from 2003 to 2007 for ‘B’ Division. The ‘C’ Girls were National 2nd Runners-up and 1st Runners-up in 2001 and 2002 respectively. The team achieved her five-year-goal with two teams in the National Top Eight in 2004.

Our players not only acquire Volleyball playing skills in the sport, but will also become more resilient by overcoming challenges. With programmes and activities to develop perseverance and time-management skills, the majority of our players do well in their academic studies too. Players are also given ample opportunities to organise inter-class competitions so as to develop their leadership and organisational skills. A large number of our Volleyball players have been selected to serve as Class or Student Leaders, resulting in Excellent grades in CCA records.
