<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Our club consists of close to 40 passionate members who have worked towards
embracing the spirit of professionalism that the club espouses. It operates
primarily as a support platform, assisting the school in terms of providing
professional AV and photography support during events. In addition to this,
the club also performs collaborative work with the different CCAs.</p>
<p>There are two broad areas which we focus on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Audio-Visual Support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Event Photography</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Audio-Visual Support</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are trained on operating audio-visual equipment, such as the
sound mixer and stage lighting to support the school during major school
events. Some school-wide events that we support include the Chinese New
Year Celebration, TASAD (Teachers’ and Staff Appreciation Day) and Racial
Harmony Day.</p>
<p><strong>Event Photography</strong>
</p>
<p>Our members are trained in photography and photo-editing skills where
they attend courses conducted by professional trainers and go on learning
journeys to practise their photography and handling of DSLR cameras. Their
subsequent work from this learning opportunity is then collated and showcased
to the school. Their photographic eye is further honed through covering
major school events throughout the school year. Members are also afforded
the opportunity to take part in external photography workshops and competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Videography</strong>
</p>
<p>Our members are trained in videography skills, from the conceptualisation
and storyboarding stage to the editing stage. To develop their creativity
and video production skills, our members produce their own clips for the
school and take part in external competitions. It is in this area that
the club has grown further in recent times, afforded by its collaboration
with other CCAs in producing instructional videos. Moving forward, the
club would be expanding its collaboration with important school committees
in producing informational videos.</p>
<p><strong>Live Streaming Support&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are trained in using Twitch and OBS Studio platforms in supporting
major school events. Some school-wide events that we support include the
Chinese New Year Celebration, TASAD (Teachers’ Day Celebration) and Racial
Harmony Day.</p>
<p><strong>Values in Action (VIA) Projects</strong>
</p>
<p>Our club also emphasises service to the community, and this focus culminates
in several VIA initiatives, planned and executed by our members. They are
given the necessary support with regard to initiatives that allow them
to apply their skills in addressing needs identified. Our members have
also led various service initiatives in the school, such as a class photography
initiative.</p>
<p><strong>Leadership Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>Members have ample opportunities to develop their leadership capabilities
and step up as leaders in the CCA. It is an area that we give particular
focus to, using the period of their involvement in our CCA to grow themselves
in terms of character and ability. They can aspire to be our CCA Chairperson
or aspire to take up other roles in the committee.</p>
