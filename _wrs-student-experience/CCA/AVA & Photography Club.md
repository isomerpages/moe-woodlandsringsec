#### **About the CCA**

Our club consists of close to 40 passionate members who have worked towards embracing the spirit of professionalism that the club espouses. It operates primarily as a support platform, assisting the school in terms of providing professional AV and photography support during events. In addition to this, the club also performs collaborative work with the different CCAs.

There are two broad areas which we focus on: 
* Audio-Visual Support
* Event Photography


**Audio-Visual Support** 

Students are trained on operating audio-visual equipment, such as the sound mixer and stage lighting to support the school during major school events. Some school-wide events that we support include the Chinese New Year Celebration, TASAD (Teachers’ and Staff Appreciation Day) and Racial Harmony Day.   

**Event Photography**

Our members are trained in photography and photo-editing skills where they attend courses conducted by professional trainers and go on learning journeys to practise their photography and handling of DSLR cameras. Their subsequent work from this learning opportunity is then collated and showcased to the school. Their photographic eye is further honed through covering major school events throughout the school year. Members are also afforded the opportunity to take part in external photography workshops and competitions.

**Videography**

Our members are trained in videography skills, from the conceptualisation and storyboarding stage to the editing stage. To develop their creativity and video production skills, our members produce their own clips for the school and take part in external competitions. It is in this area that the club has grown further in recent times, afforded by its collaboration with other CCAs in producing instructional videos. Moving forward, the club would be expanding its collaboration with important school committees in producing informational videos.

**Values in Action (VIA) Projects**

Our club also emphasises service to the community, and this focus culminates in several VIA initiatives, planned and executed by our members. They are given the necessary support with regard to initiatives that allow them to apply their skills in addressing needs identified. Our members have also led various service initiatives in the school, such as a class photography initiative.

**Leadership Opportunities**

Members have ample opportunities to develop their leadership capabilities and step up as leaders in the CCA. It is an area that we give particular focus to, using the period of their involvement in our CCA to grow themselves in terms of character and ability. They can aspire to be our CCA Chairperson or aspire to take up other roles in the committee.
