#### **About the CCA**

The Woodlands Ring Secondary School Concert Band (WRS Concert Band) is a dynamic CCA which promises an activity-filled and musically engaging experience for our students.

Led by our band directors Mr. Ben Pei and Mr.Yeo Jia Yuan, students are exposed to a variety of music from different genres – ranging from band classics, marches, oldies to K-pop and modern-day popular music. 
WRS Concert Band contributes to the aesthetically vibrant culture of the school by regularly performing at various school functions like Uniformed Group CCAs’ Commemorative Day parades and WRS NDP parade. We are also an active contributor to the community by performing at Chinese New Year dinner and National Day Parade events organised by Woodlands CC. 

To help further the playing competencies of our students, we regularly participate in exchange programmes with other secondary schools and attend master classes by professional tutors and conductors. Students with prior music experience or with music talent may also be invited to be part of the Talent Development Programme where they are given additional opportunities to perform and explore different forms of music making. Students are also given the opportunity to perform virtually through e-performances and recordings.

In line with our school mission to nurture responsible, caring and independent individuals, WRS Concert Band frequently collaborates with other CCAs to perform, like parades for NCC Commemorative, NPCC Commemorative and NCDCC Commemorative Days, and National Day. Our students had also the opportunity to experience public performance for Lions Club Nanyang 21st Anniversary Charity Lunch and School Production: A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

WRS Concert Band strives to give students a rewarding learning experience where they can grow as individuals and as musicians throughout their journey with us.

**Targeted Student Profile**

Students who are fond of music, possess a teachable attitude and are willing to commit to the CCA for the whole of his/her Secondary school life. Students with prior music experience are preferred, but not a requirement.

The band expects a high level of commitment, discipline, resilience and accountability from its members. Members must pass stipulated assessments to qualify for participation in performances (e.g. SYF)

 **CCA Trial Procedures**

Students will go through up to five training stations and an interview. The first four training stations will involve students attempting to produce sound on the different instrument groups (flute / single reed / lower brass / higher brass). The fifth station assesses students’ rhythm and tone. 

The assessment will either be done by the music director, teachers, or recorded with the help of senior band members. The whole selection process may take up to 1.5 hours to complete.
