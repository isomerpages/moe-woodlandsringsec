| **About the CCA:** | The Woodlands Ring Secondary School Concert Band (WRS Concert Band) is a dynamic CCA which promises an activity-filled and musically engaging experience for our students.Led by our band directors Mr Kenneth Lun and Mr Fabian Lim, students are exposed to a variety of music from different genres – ranging from band classics, marches, oldies to K-pop and modern-day popular music.WRS Concert Band contributes to the aesthetically vibrant culture of the school by regularly performing at various school functions. We are also an active contributor to the community by performing at National Day Events organized by Woodlands CC and at charity events organized by the Lion’s Club of Singapore. The Band also participates in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Central Judging for Concert Bands and the Singapore International Band Festival (SIBF).<br><br>To help further the playing competencies of our students, we regularly participate in exchange programmes with other secondary schools and attend master classes by professional tutors and conductors. Students with prior music experience or with music talent may also be invited to be part of the Talent Development Programme where they are given additional opportunities to perform and explore different forms of music making. Students are also given the opportunity to perform virtually through e-performances and recordings<br>In line with our school mission to nurture responsible, caring and independent individuals, WRS Concert Band also organizes our own series of band concerts entitled BRAVISSIMO! We frequently collaborate with other CCAs to perform, working with the choir during Bravissimo! VII in 2017, the Guzheng Ensemble during Bravissimo! VIII in 2018 and WRSS Shared Memories Production in 2019. Our students in the Talent Development Programme had the opportunity to collaborate with Music Elements Pte. Ltd on 2020 NDP production on the song ‘Home’. Our senior band had also dedicated a 2021 TASAD video to all WRSS teachers and staff with the song, ‘Spirited Away’.<br>WRS Concert Band strives to give students a rewarding learning experience where they can grow as individuals and as musicians throughout their journey with us. |
