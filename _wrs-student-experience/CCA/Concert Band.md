<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Woodlands Ring Secondary School Concert Band (WRS Concert Band) is
a dynamic CCA which promises an activity-filled and musically engaging
experience for our students.</p>
<p>Led by our band directors Mr. Yeo Jie Yuan and Mr. Ben Pei, students are
exposed to a variety of music from different genres – ranging from band
classics, marches, oldies to K-pop and modern-day popular music.</p>
<p>WRS Concert Band contributes to the school’s vibrant arts culture by performing
regularly at major events such as Chinese New Year, Racial Harmony Day,
the Uniformed Group CCAs’ Commemorative Day parades, and the WRS National
Day Parade. In 2025, we also successfully organised and performed in Bravissimo!
X, a major concert held in the school hall that showcased the dedication,
musical growth, and achievements of our students together with our alumni.
Aligned with the school’s mission to nurture responsible, caring, and independent
individuals, the band frequently collaborates with other CCAs, such as
NCC, NPCC, and NCDCC, for parade performances. Beyond school, our students
have gained valuable public performance experience through opportunities
like the Lions Club Nanyang 21st Anniversary Charity Lunch and the school
production A Midsummer Night’s Dream in 2024.</p>
<p>We are an active contributor to the community as well, performing at Chinese
New Year dinner and National Day Parade events organised by Woodlands CC
at Kampung Admiralty.</p>
<p>To help further the playing competencies of our students, we regularly
participate in exchange programmes with other secondary schools and attend
master classes by professional tutors and conductors.</p>
<p>WRS Concert Band strives to give students a rewarding learning experience
where they can grow as individuals and as musicians throughout their journey
with us.</p>
