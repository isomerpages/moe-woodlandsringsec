#### **About the CCA**

The WRSS Badminton Team aims to develop our students holistically to be student-athletes who model the school values of Responsibility, Respect and Resilience, and embodies commitment, dedication, and discipline consistently, in school or out of school.
Our programme seeks to achieve that through the weekly training sessions where students hone their skills, physical endurance, and mental endurance in preparation for the annual North Zone Tournaments. There are also many opportunities weaved into the programme for all-round development, such as leading and collaborating through peer coaching during the weekly sessions; leadership and organisational skills are also developed through planning and executing of school and CCA events such as the CCA Open House, WRS Sports Carnival, WRS Primary School Experience and Badminton Camp. 

It will be a rewarding journey for the students as they grow to become the student-athlete of robust character that we envision.
