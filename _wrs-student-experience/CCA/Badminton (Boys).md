<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The WRSS Badminton Team aims to develop our students holistically to be
student-athletes who model the school values of Responsibility, Respect
and Resilience, and embodies commitment, dedication, and discipline consistently,
in school or out of school.</p>
<p>Our programme seeks to achieve that through the weekly training sessions
where students hone their skills, physical endurance, and mental endurance
in preparation for the annual North Zone Tournament.</p>
<p>There are also many opportunities weaved into the programme for all-round
development, such as leading and collaborating through peer coaching during
the weekly sessions; leadership and organisational skills are also developed
through planning and executing of school and CCA events such as the CCA
Open House, WRS Sports Carnival, WRS Primary School Experience and Badminton
Camp.</p>
<p>It will be a rewarding journey for the students as they grow to become
the student-athlete of robust character that we envision.</p>
