<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>Basketball is one of the most popular team sports globally. The WRS Basketball
Programme engages our members physically, mentally, and holistically, providing
them with opportunities to compete and hone their skills. Through training,
competitions, and participation in various activities, our players learn
valuable life lessons and develop important character traits, becoming
a disciplined, mature, and resilient basketball team.</p>
<p>The team participates in various competitions and Values-in-Action (VIA)
activities to enhance students’ learning.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The National School Games is one of the key highlights of the year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Friendly matches against other schools provide meaningful opportunities
for WRS students to interact, exchange skills, and learn from others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School Invitationals serve as an additional platform for players to discover,
reflect, develop, and strengthen their teamwork and sportsmanship.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>WRS Basketball provides members with leadership opportunities through
various team appointments. Members are involved in planning, executing,
and leading different programmes within the team, such as CCA Orientation,
Team Bonding Sessions, Celebration Day, Sec 4 Farewell, and the WRS Open
House.</p>
<p>WRS Basketball is more than just a game — it is a holistic experience
that nurtures students’ character, values, leadership, and decision-making
skills. The programme aims to develop boys into strong, determined, and
quick-thinking young men who demonstrate teamwork, discipline, and selflessness
both on and off the court.</p>
