#### **About the CCA**

Basketball is one of the most popular team sports. WRS basketball programme engages our members physically, mentally and holistically and provides our players with opportunities to compete and hone their skills.  In preparing for the competitions and through participation in various activities, our players learn life lessons and develop valuable character traits to be a disciplined, matured and resilient Basketball team.

The team participates in various competitions and Values in Action (VIA) activities to enable our students to learn.
* The National School Games is one of the highlights of the year. 
* Friendly matches against different schools provide another new sporting experience for WRS students to interact and learn from others. 
* Bukit Merah Cup is a competition that provides opportunities for our players to discover, reflect, develop and strengthen our team play.

There are different appointments in WRS Basketball that provide our members with the opportunities to plan, execute and lead different programmes within the team. Some programmes include CCA Bazaar, Team Bonding sessions and Celebration Day, Sec 4 Farewell, WRS Sports Carnival, WRS School Experience etc. 

All in all, WRS Basketball is beyond a game. It is a total package that will develop students in their personal characters, values, leadership and decision-making skills. We strongly recommend this game for boys to become strong, determined and fast thinking young men who play in a selfless team manner.
