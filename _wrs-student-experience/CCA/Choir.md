#### **About the CCA**

WRS Choir is known as ‘Concordia Choir’.  ‘Concordia’ is a Latin word which means ‘harmony’.  We sing a wide genre of songs ranging from classical to popular music and music of various languages and cultures.  We engage in both indoor and outdoor activities as part of our training and to build rapport among members. 

Our Choir meets twice a week in a collaborative environment to express ourselves through singing and to develop our skills.  We perform on various platforms and participate in competitions to deepen our learning and showcase our talents.  They include:
* ‘Dreaming of A Midsummer Night’s Dream’ School Production 2024 
* National Day School Concert
* Hari Raya School Concert
* Chinese New Year School Concert
* Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation (2021, 2023)
* Journeying with Song- a choral soundscape (A collaboration with Choral Directors Association Singapore and Esplanade - 2021)
* Voices of Singapore Festival (2022, 2023, 2024)

To provide a variety of learning experiences for our members, the Choir also participates in learning journeys, workshops and school exchange programmes:
* Schools Exchange programmes (2017 - 2024)
* Body Percussion Workshop by Richard Filz (2020)

Through the four-year journey in Concordia Choir, we look forward to seeing our members develop into vibrant and confident leaders passionate about music. We move forward together, growing and learning as a choir.
