<p><strong>About the CCA</strong>
</p>
<p>WRS Choir is known as ‘<em>Concordia Choir</em>’.&nbsp; ‘<em>Concordia</em>’
is a Latin word which means ‘harmony’.&nbsp; We sing a wide genre of songs,
spanning from classical to popular music, as well as music from various
languages and cultures.&nbsp; We participate in both indoor and outdoor
activities as part of our training and to build rapport among members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Choir meets twice a week in a collaborative environment to express
ourselves through singing and to develop our skills.&nbsp; We perform on
various platforms and compete to deepen our learning and showcase our talents.&nbsp;
