<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>An exciting game that demands the use of skills like catching, throwing,
running and batting to excel in the game. Besides, it is a game that requires
a very strong mental will to sustain. The WRS Wildcubs is a big family
whose members play as hard as they study. Members of the Wildcubs get to
experience various competitions and carnivals such as the National Softball
tournaments, the SRC Softball carnivals and our very own WRSS Invitational
tournaments.</p>
