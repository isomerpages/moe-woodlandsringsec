#### **About the CCA**

An exciting game that demands the use of skills like catching, throwing, running and batting to excel in the game. Besides, it is a game that requires a very strong mental will to sustain. The WRS Wildcubs is a big family whose members play as hard as they study. Members of the Wildcubs get to experience various competitions and carnivals such as the National Softball tournaments, the SRC Softball carnivals and our very own WRSS Invitational tournaments.

**WRS Softball Team Motto - Play with Passion, Roar with Pride!**
