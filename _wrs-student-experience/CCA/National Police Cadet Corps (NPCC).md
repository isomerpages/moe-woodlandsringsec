**Expenses to be borne by students**

All cadets are provided with two sets of NCC uniforms (free of charge). They are allowed to do kit-exchange at the beginning of each year for misfit sizes or worn-off items. However, they have to bear the full cost for any lost item.

Enrichment Courses such as 1-Star Kayaking will be co-paid between school and students through Edusave account or by cash (for PR/non-Singaporean). FAS students will be subsidised.

**Targeted Student Profile**

While some activities can be strenuous, they are gradual and progressive. All teacher officers take a serious view on the well-being and safety of every cadet.

Cadets will be challenged by choice to carry out any activity, and teacher officers will provide the necessary guidance and support.
Cadets with a positive mindset will gain meaningful and enjoyable learning experiences.

All teacher officers are committed to monitoring the well-being and holistic development of every cadet to ensure a good balance between studies and NCC activities.
