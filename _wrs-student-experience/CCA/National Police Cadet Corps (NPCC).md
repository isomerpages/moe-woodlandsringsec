#### **About the CCA**

Our mission in NPCC is to develop our cadets into community leaders who 
* value discipline and teamwork
* face challenges bravely and pursue excellence
* fight crime in partnership with Singapore Police Force
* are caring and responsible

Our cadets go through a structured and progressive training programme that challenges and develops them into selfless and resilient leaders who possess integrity and persevere in adverse and rugged contexts. Their growth and development is guided by NPCC’s Learning Path: 

| Level 1 | Aware of Self and Others | Knowing oneself |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Level 2  | Acquire skills and knowledge     | Stepping out and interacting     |
| Level 3 | Actuate as leader | First taste of taking charge |
| Level 4/5    | Aspire to serve     | Stepping out to lead     |

Some of our unique programmes include:
* Leadership Programme - Cadets plan camps, online and face-to-face training and execute them to learn experientially what it means to be a leader.
* Outdoor activities such as campcraft training and adventure training camps at NPCC HQ’s campsite on Pulau Ubin
* Courses related to work of Singapore Police Force such as Crime Scene Investigation (CSI), Cybercrime Prevention, Police Procedures, Basic Law and SG Secure
