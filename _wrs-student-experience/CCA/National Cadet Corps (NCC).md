<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The NCC Syllabus is gradual and progressive. It aims to provide a diverse
range of challenging and enriching activities. The five broad objectives
of our activities are <strong>Character Building</strong>, <strong>National Education</strong>, <strong>Adventurous Spirit</strong>, <strong>Leadership and Military Awareness</strong>.</p>
<p>NCC is guided by <strong>3 key thrusts</strong> – Leadership, Fitness and
Commitment to Singapore and is driven by <strong>8 core values</strong> –
Loyalty to Country, Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline, Commitment &amp;
Responsibility, Care for Fellow Cadets, Adventurous Spirit and Safety.</p>
<p>NCC has a Leadership Competency Model (LCM) that ensures cadets are equipped
with sound leadership skills at the end of 4 to 5 years.</p>
<p>During their 1<sup>st</sup> year, the cadets learn basic military knowledge
and skills such as the history and role of SAF and NCC, Footdrills, Individual
Field Craft (IFC) and Orienteering. They are initiated into NCC through
the HQ’s Affirmation Ceremony and our unit’s Camp VALUES where they get
to learn campcraft and participate in the Unit Hike. NCC HQ also organises
Camp FORGE to build confidence in the cadets through adventure elements.</p>
<p>During their 2<sup>nd</sup> year, the cadets will deepen their knowledge
of the military skills they have learnt in the 1<sup>st</sup> year. Besides
more advanced drills, IFC and Orienteering, they are also introduced to
the fundamentals of shooting through an Air Rifle Shooting program organised
by NCC HQ. In addition, they will attend another adventure camp called
Camp STEEL which focuses on the value of teamwork. Cadets will also learn
life skills and build up their ruggedness through other adventure activities
such as the Unit Hike.</p>
<p>During their 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> / 5<sup>th</sup> year, the
cadets will be given the opportunity to lead, plan and execute training
programmes. The aim is to allow the cadets to pick up leadership skills
under the guidance of teacher officers. To ensure that the cadets can impart
the necessary military knowledge confidently, NCC conducts Specialist Assessment
in which they earn the rank of third sergeant and the Army-NCC badge. Outstanding
cadets will attend the Senior Specialist Leaders Course and they can look
forward to becoming key appointment holders in the school’s NCC unit. In
addition, cadets hone their SAR21 marksmanship in the Individual Marksmanship
Training and Live Shooting program organised by NCC HQ.</p>
<p>In line with the school’s strategic thrust of Character Excellence, the
NCC unit also embarks on meaningful service-learning project each year
to inculcate in cadets, a sense of responsibility to their immediate community,
and to enable them to understand that they too can become active contributors
to their society.</p>
