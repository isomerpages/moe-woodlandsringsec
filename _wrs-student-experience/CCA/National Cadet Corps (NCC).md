| **About the CCA:** | The NCC Syllabus is gradual and progressive. It aims to provide a diverse range of challenging and enriching activities. The five broad objectives of our activities are **Character Building, National Education, Adventurous Spirit, Leadership and Military Awareness**.NCC is guided by **3 thrusts** – Leadership, Fitness and Commitment to Singapore and is driven by **8 core values** – Loyalty to Country, Uprightness, Leadership, Discipline, Commitment & Responsibility, Care for Fellow Cadets, Adventurous Spirit and Safety.NCC has a Leadership Competency Model (LCM) that ensures cadets are equipped with sound leadership skills at the end of 4 to 5 years.During their 1st year, cadets learn basic military knowledge and skills such as the history and role of SAF and NCC, as well as skills such as SAR 21 weapon handling and individual field crafts. NCC HQ also organises Camp FORGE to build confidence in the cadets through adventure elements.During their 2nd year, cadets will attend another adventure camp called Camp STEEL which focuses on the value of teamwork. Cadets will also learn life skills and build up their ruggedness through other adventure activities such as Basic Orienteering Course and 1-Star Kayaking Course.<br><br>During their 3rd and 4th / 5th year, cadets will be given the opportunity to plan and execute training programmes. The aim is to allow the cadets to pick up leadership skills under the guidance of teacher officers. To ensure that the cadets can impart the necessary military knowledge on SAR 21 rifle and individual field crafts confidently, NCC conducts Specialist Assessment in which they earn the rank of third sergeant and the Army-NCC badge. Outstanding cadets will attend the Senior Specialist Leaders Course and they can look forward to becoming key appointment holders in the school’s NCC unit.<br><br>All cadets are encouraged to learn freestyle drill and precision drill movements which build teamwork and resilience. Besides having a chance to participate in Freestyle Drill Competition and Precision Drill Squad Competition, cadets also perform at school-based events such as Total Defence Day Commemoration and National Day Celebration.<br><br>In line with the school’s strategic thrust of Character Excellence, the NCC unit also embarks on meaningful service-learning project each year to inculcate in cadets, a sense of responsibility to their immediate community, and to enable them to understand that they too can become active contributors to their society |
