#### **About the CCA**

The Media Resource Library (MRL) Club is an active learning hub that supports students in their pursuit of learning with its rich resources. Student librarians receive opportunities to foster a love for reading and learning by creating publicity material, participating in book talks, organising book-related activities and attending enrichment courses to develop the necessary skills needed as student librarians.

Throughout the year, the MRL Club works with our partners, National Library Board (NLB), MOE MRL and Civica in organising book-related activities. Student librarians also organise interclass competitions related to events that promote social bonding among students and occasionally, teachers. When the opportunity arises, student librarians are also invited to participate in inter-school competitions.
