<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>The Media Resource Library (MRL) Club is an active learning hub that supports
students in their pursuit of learning with its rich resources. Student
librarians receive opportunities to foster a love for reading and learning
by creating publicity material, participating in book talks, organising
book related activities and attending enrichment courses to develop the
necessary skills needed as student librarians.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, the MRL Club works with our partners, National Library
Board (NLB), MOE MRL and Civica in organising book-related activities.
Student librarians also organise interclass competitions related to events
that promote social bonding among students and occasionally, teachers.
When the opportunity arises, student librarians are also invited to participate
in inter-school competitions.</p>
