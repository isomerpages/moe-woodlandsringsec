<h4><strong>About the CCA</strong></h4>
<p>WRS Netball Club is regarded as a well-disciplined and hardworking CCA.
Members are required not only to be exemplary in behaviour but also to
show excellent performance in their studies. Netballers are dedicated and
committed in working together to achieve shared goals and success for the
team. Members are not only groomed to be skillful players on court, they
are also given opportunities to lead and organise events like the Secondary
1 CCA Bazaar, Secondary 1 CCA Trial, Farewell Event for Graduating Netballers
and the WRSS Sports Carnival.</p>
