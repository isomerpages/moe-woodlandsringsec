<p>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) is part of MOE's ongoing efforts
to nurture the joy of learning and develop multiple pathways to cater to
the different strengths and interests of our students.</p>
<p>MOE will post students to secondary school through three Posting Groups
– Posting Groups 1, 2, and students can take subjects at three subject
levels, known as G1, G2, G3 (G stands for General), mapped from the previous
N(T), N(A) and Express standards respectively.</p>

<p>Once students enter secondary school, they will be grouped into mixed
form classes comprising students from different Posting Groups and will
have opportunities to interact and learn with peers of different backgrounds,
strengths, and interests.</p>
<p>Students offered subject(s) at a more demanding level (MDL) should only
purchase the textbook after confirming the subjects they will be taking.
For students who qualify for MDL subjects, a separate PG message regarding
MDL subject(s) acceptance will be sent. &nbsp;</p>
