### **Alumni Committee**
**Vision:**  Fostering Connections, Building Relationships

**Mission:**   
* To be the bridge between the alumni and the school, enabling the alumni to continue to be a part of the WRS family.  
* To give back to the school that taught them moral values and helped develop their character.  
* To foster connections and build a network among the alumni.

The committee designed a logo that is inspired by the school song. The W in WRS is spread out, mimicking the wings of a butterfly as they have unfolded from their cocoons (as stated in the school song). The letters W, R and S are linked to represent the role of the Alumni Committee, to be the bridge between the school and all of the alumni of WRS. The three school colours have also been incorporated into the design, serving as a reminder that the alumni will always be part of the WRS community. The colours are splattered, showing the growth that they have gone through during their time in the school.

**Committee:**
The committee was formally established in 2018, in commemoration of the school's 20th anniversary. Its primary composition consists of students from diverse graduating classes, thereby reflecting the full range of skills and experiences represented by the alumni community.

The leadership of the committee has been helmed by notable alumni, namely:

* Mr. Mohamad Farhan (Class of 2011) for the period of 2018 to 2019;

* Miss Jolene Lee Pei Yun (Class of 2013) from 2020 to 2021; and

* Mr. Tang Yang Heng (Class of 2017) from 2022 to the present.

         
**Contributions:** As part of the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Programme, various distinguished alumni have been invited to impart their valuable experiences to students. These occasions include the Teach the Child Programme at the start of each academic year, career sharing sessions held during the eXperiential Week, and the annual Full-time National Serviceman (NSF) Engagement Talk.

In addition, the alumni have been actively involved in supporting the school's academic pursuits. Since 2018, alumni have been providing tutoring services during the weekly Night Study Sessions for the graduating cohort. Although these sessions were discontinued due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the alumni have plans to resume them this year to aid the current batch of graduating students.

Moreover, the alumni have consistently lent their support and participation to school events such as Sports Day, Teachers and Staff Appreciation Day, and Graduation Night. As the school's 25th anniversary approaches, the committee is organising a homecoming celebration for alumni from various graduating batches, as well as supporting the school's carnival.
