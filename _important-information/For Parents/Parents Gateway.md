### **Parents Gateway**
Parents Gateway is a mobile app available on iOS and Android for parents. It affords schools the convenience of updating parents of schools’ programmes and for parents to provide consent for their children to participate in school activities.

In partnership with the Government Technology Agency (GovTech) and as part of Singapore’s Smart Nation and Digital Government efforts, the Ministry of Education (MOE) has developed Parents Gateway – a one-stop mobile app for parents and schools to better support their children’s educational journey through improved communications. The centrally coordinated initiative, available on IOS and Android forparents, allows schools to send updates on programmes and activities. It also allows parents to perform administrative functions such as providing consent for their children to participate in school activities.
