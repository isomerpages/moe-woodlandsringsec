### **Education and Career Guidance**
##### **What is it about?**
In the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) world today, new occupations are emerging while some become obsolete. Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is important to prepare our students to be future-ready and be able to navigate the evolving landscape. Through ECG, students will acquire the necessary knowledge, skills and values to enable them to make informed education and career decisions.

##### **ECG the WRS Way**
The WRS ECG Curriculum is aligned closely to the national movement, SkillsFuture, and the MOE ECG Development Model.

The curriculum supports our students in planning for their future by providing them the information on the new developments in the educational and careers landscape. Learning opportunities are also purposefully created to allow our students to learn more about themselves, in terms of their strengths and interests, and explore what are out there before they make their decisions. Through the curriculum, life skills are developed to prepare our students for the 21st Century.

##### **Key Strategies**
The ECG unit adopts a structured and thematic approach in planning the curriculum so as to meet students’ needs by level. Programmes are also customised to provide learning opportunities for different student segments so as to deepen students’ interests and motivation towards learning.

By the end of their journey in WRSS, we hope that all students are answer the following three questions:

1\.  Who am I?<br>
2\.  Where am I going?<br>
3\.  How do I get there?

Once they are able to find the answers to the above three questions, they will discover the purpose of work and be more motivated in their learning.

##### **Programmes**
**1\. ECG Lessons**<br>
In alignment to MOE Guidance Branch guidelines, ECG is positioned as part of the Character and Citizenship (CCE) curriculum. Under this curriculum, the ECG Syllabus will involve all secondary students experiencing a minimum of 4 hours of ECG lesson delivery per year.

**2\. Enrichments**<br>
In WRS, the ECG Syllabus is supplemented with customised enrichment programmes to further enhance the outcomes of ECG.

Some of the enrichment programmes include:
