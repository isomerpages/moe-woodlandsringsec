### **The Edusave Character Award (ECHA)**
The Edusave Character Award (ECHA) is introduced by MOE in 2012 to enable schools to recognise students who demonstrate exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and action. The quota for ECHA awardees is capped at 2% of the enrolment of Singaporean students. ECHA awardees will receive a certificate and an award voucher worth $500. This is part of the larger goal to foster an inclusive and stronger Singapore as we broaden the qualities and achievements to be encouraged and applauded. The award also supports the school’s continuing efforts in nurturing students of good values and character.

Nominations for ECHA 2022 is now open. Download [Annex A](/files/annex%20a.pdf)to submit your nominations. The completed nomination form can be submitted via hardcopy at the school’s Corporate Office or through email to [oth\_sim\_sheh\_chen@moe.edu.sg](mailto:oth_sim_sheh_chen@moe.edu.sg) by 5pm on Thursday 1st September 2022.
