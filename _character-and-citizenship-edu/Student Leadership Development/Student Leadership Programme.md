<img style="width:65%" src="/images/sld%20framework.jpg">
 In WRS, we believe that all our students are leaders.

First and foremost, they must be able to lead themselves before they can lead and serve others. Through their actions, they can then inspire others to follow.

That is why student leadership development in our school enables all students to be equipped with leadership skills to manage self and to make a positive difference to others.

To achieve our WRS CCE desired outcomes of Active Citizens, Vibrant Leaders, the following principles guide us.

*   Set high expectations – a values-driven leadership development ground leadership in sound values and ensures that these future nation contributors would ethically achieve goals.
*   Teach Lifeskills – a student-centric leadership development caters to differentiated groups of leaders and provides them with an authentic experiential learning environment to hone their 21CC & SEL skills.
*   Provide Opportunities – numerous platforms for Student Leaders to initiate and take the lead in planning and executing level-wide or school-wide events.

All these are done by leveraging students’ voice, role modeling and community partnership.
