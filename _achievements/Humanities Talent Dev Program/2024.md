<h4><strong>Student Archivist Project</strong></h4>
<p>The Student Archivist Project is an oral history project organised by
the Founders’ Memorial and National Museum of Singapore. Student interviewers
collect personal stories by interviewing Singaporeans who are in their
60s, about specific topics such as housing in Singapore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Our participants for this year are Nur Daleelah Az Zahrah Muhammad
Yasseer from 1R1, Chew Yen Ning from 1R3, Jaylen Lee Yu Chen from 1R6 and
Zheng Jinyu from 1R7. The students commented that they felt privileged
to discover the history of Singapore through the lenses of those who built
our nation. Discussion about the project typically begin in January and
students have up to 7 months for planning and production.</p>

<h4><strong>River Valley Model United Nations</strong></h4>
<p>&nbsp;The River Valley Model United Nations prides itself on youth empowerment
by furnishing them with knowledge and skills to understand and address
the intricacies and complexities of our current world and international
relations. It aims to provide student delegates with the critical insight
into global issues and foster a sense of responsibility and integrity in
addressing and finding solutions to these challenges. Each student is assigned
a country to represent.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The school’s MUN journey began with a joint Mock Model United Nations
session with Beatty Secondary School in November 2023. Building on that
foundation, students participated in their first official MUN event, the
RVMUN.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year’s theme is ‘Ad Via Futurum’, signifying the way to the future.
The RVMUN Secretariat envisions RVMUN 2024 as a catalyst for the personal
and leadership development of its delegates, fostering their growth into
future leaders. Embracing this new era, the Secretariat aspires to curate
an immersive and substantive experience, tailored to benefit delegates
of diverse backgrounds and levels of expertise. Our delegation is represented
this year by two students - Tan Songjie, Eitan from 3R4 and Elzhar Muhaimin
Bin Mazelan from 3R6A. With this experience under their belt, the students
are keen to sign up for MUN events in the subsequent years.</p>

<h4><strong>Nan Hua ASEAN Forum</strong></h4>
<p>The Nan Hua ASEAN Forum provides a platform for our Secondary 3 students
to explore issues and challenges faced by ASEAN member states, as well
as an opportunity to think about workable solutions to further the region’s
development.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Some of the topics covered include the Belt and Road Initiative and conflicts
over the South China Sea. Exposure to regional issues helped the students
to open their minds to multiple perspectives. A participant from our school
came to the conclusion that <em>“The world today is very complicated. It made me think about geopolitical tensions which all citizens should be concerned about. The information and perspectives shared about ASEAN and China would help me appreciate better what I read in the news.”</em>

Amelia Chua from 3R4 as well as Tan Jia Xu and Si Jordan Lloyd Gravador
from 3R5.</p>
