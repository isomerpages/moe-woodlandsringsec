<h3><strong>Humanities Talent Development Programme</strong></h3>
<h5><strong>River Valley Model United Nations (RVMUN) 2022</strong></h5>
<p>Six of our Secondary Three students took part in the RVMUN 2022, a three-day
conference held over Zoom during the March Holidays. In RVMUN 2022, the
students took on the role of delegates from countries in the various UN
committees. The delegates would debate on issues faced in the current geopolitical
context and come to a consensus on the proposed solutions to existing problems.
&nbsp;During the process, the students understood more about the functions
of the UN and the challenges it faces. They also sharpened their critical
thinking skills through understanding different perspectives and synthesizing
information. &nbsp;Our students also enjoyed forging new friendships with
other delegates through the committee debates.</p>
<p>It was certainly an enriching experience to which one student asked, “when
is the next conference”?</p>

<p>Although the students were in different committees, they took the opportunity
to share their experiences in real time when they carried out the Zoom
session in school.</p>
<h5><strong>One Hack At A Time (OHAT) 2022 Social Studies Hackathon</strong></h5>
<p>The ‘One Hack At A Time’ Social Studies Hackathon was held at Red Box
Singapore on 28 and 29 June 2022. Through student-led inquiry processes,
the hackathon serves as a meaningful platform for&nbsp;students to draw
connections between what they have learnt about trade-offs, citizenship,
and governance in Social Studies to contemporary issues in Singapore.</p>
<p>This year, nine of our Secondary Three students were selected to participate
in the hackathon. In line with this year’s theme: ‘YOUth Can: Create a
Sustainable Singapore’, the students worked together in teams to pitch
creative solutions on the topic of sustainability in three key areas: (a)
Climate Change, (b) Heritage and Memory, and (c) Urban Planning.&nbsp;By
the end of the hackathon, the students did not merely walk away with new
friendships, but also new understandings about what they can do to ensure
a sustainable future for Singapore.</p>
<p>We would also like to congratulate two of our students for their stellar
achievements at the hackathon! They are: Kate Thanthar Myat Noe Oo (3E3),
who received the ‘Best Speaker’ Award, and Nur Nabilah Binte Mohd Sairi
(3E2A), who was awarded the ‘Most Inquisitive’ Award.</p>

<h5><strong>NAN HUA HIGH SCHOOL – NATIONAL YOUTH ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE (NYEC) 2022</strong></h5>
<p>Four of our Secondary Three students took part in the NYEC 2022, a two-day
conference held over Zoom during the March Holidays. Through a Model United
Nations (MUN) Conference format, students role-played as delegates from
various countries to discuss the latest global environmental issues and
come up with innovative solutions.</p>
<p>The students honed their critical thinking skills as they discussed and
worked together with other participants to reach a common consensus on
what mitigation strategies can be proposed. They gained new friendships
with participants from other schools and built self-confidence as they
shared their ideas with one another.</p>

with participants from other schools.</p>
<h5><strong>Singapore Archivist Project (SAP) 2022</strong></h5>
<p>Eight secondary one students participated in the SAP 2022.&nbsp; SAP is
an oral history project involving student interviewers and senior interviewees
speaking about the impact of developments in the field of public health
and medicine between the 1950s and 1970s in Singapore. The interviewees
were Mr Junaidi, as well as Mdm Ramla, both who are currently working at
Woodlands Ring Secondary School. The students prepared the types of interview
questions after having attended a training session with the organizer from
the Singapore Heritage Board. At the end of the project, the students reflected
that they could have prepared better questions and worked on their volume
and clarity during the interview. On the whole, the students agreed that
‘the experience was fun and valuable’.</p>

<h5><strong>ASEAN Symposium 2022</strong></h5>
<p>Ten of our Secondary Three students took part in the ASEAN Symposium 2022,
a two-day Symposium held over Zoom on 22 April and 15 July. This Symposium
was organised by ASEAN Studies Centre and Kranji Secondary School, and
supported by Humanities Branch MOE. The theme of this year’s Symposium
is “The Future of ASEAN”, and students had the opportunity to discuss various
aspects of ASEAN’s development during the breakout rooms in the first session.</p>
<p>Before the second session, the team analysed the socio-economic problems
ASEAN faces and came up with some proposed solutions to them. &nbsp;In
the second session, three student presenters from WRSS brought the audience
in the breakout room through an analysis of ASEAN’s economic development
and its ensuing impacts, and the ways in which ASEAN could mitigate these
impacts. It was certainly an enriching experience for the students. In
the words of Hairul, the team leader: “the team has certainly gone beyond
their comfort zone and helped each other along the way.”</p>
<h5><strong>Secondary 1 Week X Big Bus Tour</strong></h5>
<p>Sitting on top of the Big Bus, the Secondary 1ENA students went on a tour
of the Civic Business District and Ethnic Districts during the first week
of Term 2 as part of the Week X programme. This was the first time the
Secondary 1ENA students went on the Big Bus tour since 2019, as the 2020
and 2021 editions were shelved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During
the tour, the class’s history teacher would explain to the students the
historical significance of the various landmarks and the context behind
each living quarter in downtown Singapore.</p>
<p>Through this experience, the students learnt more about Singapore’s history
and developed historical empathy for the generations of Singaporeans who
were essentially in laying the basis for modern-day Singapore’s success.
It was also refreshing for the students to learn beyond the classroom setting
and in an immersive environment.</p>

<h5><strong>Geographical Investigation</strong></h5>
<p>Our Geography unit designs geographical investigations (GI) where students
investigate a geographical issue. In groups, students will analyse the
GI question, plan their research, gather data, analyse data, construct
geographical interpretations, as well as evaluate and communicate their
findings in the process.</p>
<p>At Lower Secondary level, students collaboratively investigate authentic
geographical issue such as&nbsp;<em>learning how human affect the physical environment</em>&nbsp;(in
Secondary 1), and&nbsp;<em>uncovering why certain features in the neighborhood impact the environment and people living there</em>&nbsp;(in
Secondary 2). Students go through the processes of GI and are given hands
on experiences such as water testing and conducting surveys with residents
of Kampung Admiralty.</p>
<p>Our Upper Secondary curriculum adopts an inquiry-based approach to the
learning of Physical and/or Human Geography. Through GI, our students acquaint
themselves to the various fieldwork techniques to better appreciate the
dynamic nature of Singapore’s tropical environment. Our Full Geography
students travelled to Sembawang Park to measure sediment sizes, beach gradient,
wave height and wave frequency using various fieldwork equipment. Our Elective
Geography students on the other hand, are given the opportunity to use
weather tracker within the school campus to understand dynamic weather
patterns.</p>
<p>These carefully curated tasks allow learners to exercise their Geographical
skills and knowledge, while appreciating the real-world application of
Geography. We believe that over time, our students will develop a deeper
understanding of our changing world and be better prepared for the complexities
of the 21st&nbsp;century.</p>
