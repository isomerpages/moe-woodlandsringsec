### **Humanities Talent Development Programme**

##### **River Valley Model United Nations (RVMUN) 2022**

Six of our Secondary Three students took part in the RVMUN 2022, a three-day conference held over Zoom during the March Holidays. In RVMUN 2022, the students took on the role of delegates from countries in the various UN committees. The delegates would debate on issues faced in the current geopolitical context and come to a consensus on the proposed solutions to existing problems. &nbsp;During the process, the students understood more about the functions of the UN and the challenges it faces. They also sharpened their critical thinking skills through understanding different perspectives and synthesizing information. &nbsp;Our students also enjoyed forging new friendships with other delegates through the committee debates.

It was certainly an enriching experience to which one student asked, “when is the next conference”?

Although the students were in different committees, they took the opportunity to share their experiences in real time when they carried out the Zoom session in school.

##### **One Hack At A Time (OHAT) 2022 Social Studies Hackathon**
The ‘One Hack At A Time’ Social Studies Hackathon was held at Red Box Singapore on 28 and 29 June 2022. Through student-led inquiry processes, the hackathon serves as a meaningful platform for&nbsp;students to draw connections between what they have learnt about trade-offs, citizenship, and governance in Social Studies to contemporary issues in Singapore.

This year, nine of our Secondary Three students were selected to participate in the hackathon. In line with this year’s theme: ‘YOUth Can: Create a Sustainable Singapore’, the students worked together in teams to pitch creative solutions on the topic of sustainability in three key areas: (a) Climate Change, (b) Heritage and Memory, and (c) Urban Planning.&nbsp;By the end of the hackathon, the students did not merely walk away with new friendships, but also new understandings about what they can do to ensure a sustainable future for Singapore.

We would also like to congratulate two of our students for their stellar achievements at the hackathon! They are: Kate Thanthar Myat Noe Oo (3E3), who received the ‘Best Speaker’ Award, and Nur Nabilah Binte Mohd Sairi (3E2A), who was awarded the ‘Most Inquisitive’ Award.

##### **NAN HUA HIGH SCHOOL – NATIONAL YOUTH ENVIRONMENT CONFERENCE (NYEC) 2022**

Four of our Secondary Three students took part in the NYEC 2022, a two-day conference held over Zoom during the March Holidays. Through a Model United Nations (MUN) Conference format, students role-played as delegates from various countries to discuss the latest global environmental issues and come up with innovative solutions.

The students honed their critical thinking skills as they discussed and worked together with other participants to reach a common consensus on what mitigation strategies can be proposed. They gained new friendships with participants from other schools and built self-confidence as they shared their ideas with one another.

The students concluded the conference on a good note after fruitful discussions with participants from other schools.

##### **Singapore Archivist Project (SAP) 2022**

Eight secondary one students participated in the SAP 2022.&nbsp; SAP is an oral history project involving student interviewers and senior interviewees speaking about the impact of developments in the field of public health and medicine between the 1950s and 1970s in Singapore. The interviewees were Mr Junaidi, as well as Mdm Ramla, both who are currently working at Woodlands Ring Secondary School. The students prepared the types of interview questions after having attended a training session with the organizer from the Singapore Heritage Board. At the end of the project, the students reflected that they could have prepared better questions and worked on their volume and clarity during the interview. On the whole, the students agreed that ‘the experience was fun and valuable’.

##### **ASEAN Symposium 2022**
Ten of our Secondary Three students took part in the ASEAN Symposium 2022, a two-day Symposium held over Zoom on 22 April and 15 July. This Symposium was organised by ASEAN Studies Centre and Kranji Secondary School, and supported by Humanities Branch MOE. The theme of this year’s Symposium is “The Future of ASEAN”, and students had the opportunity to discuss various aspects of ASEAN’s development during the breakout rooms in the first session.

Before the second session, the team analysed the socio-economic problems ASEAN faces and came up with some proposed solutions to them. &nbsp;In the second session, three student presenters from WRSS brought the audience in the breakout room through an analysis of ASEAN’s economic development and its ensuing impacts, and the ways in which ASEAN could mitigate these impacts. It was certainly an enriching experience for the students. In the words of Hairul, the team leader: “the team has certainly gone beyond their comfort zone and helped each other along the way.”

##### **Secondary 1 Week X Big Bus Tour**
Sitting on top of the Big Bus, the Secondary 1ENA students went on a tour of the Civic Business District and Ethnic Districts during the first week of Term 2 as part of the Week X programme. This was the first time the Secondary 1ENA students went on the Big Bus tour since 2019, as the 2020 and 2021 editions were shelved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the tour, the class’s history teacher would explain to the students the historical significance of the various landmarks and the context behind each living quarter in downtown Singapore.

Through this experience, the students learnt more about Singapore’s history and developed historical empathy for the generations of Singaporeans who were essentially in laying the basis for modern-day Singapore’s success. It was also refreshing for the students to learn beyond the classroom setting and in an immersive environment.

##### **Geographical Investigation**
Our Geography unit designs geographical investigations (GI) where students investigate a geographical issue. In groups, students will analyse the GI question, plan their research, gather data, analyse data, construct geographical interpretations, as well as evaluate and communicate their findings in the process.

At Lower Secondary level, students collaboratively investigate authentic geographical issue such as&nbsp;_learning how human affect the physical environment_&nbsp;(in Secondary 1), and&nbsp;_uncovering why certain features in the neighborhood impact the environment and people living there_&nbsp;(in Secondary 2). Students go through the processes of GI and are given hands on experiences such as water testing and conducting surveys with residents of Kampung Admiralty.

Our Upper Secondary curriculum adopts an inquiry-based approach to the learning of Physical and/or Human Geography. Through GI, our students acquaint themselves to the various fieldwork techniques to better appreciate the dynamic nature of Singapore’s tropical environment. Our Full Geography students travelled to Sembawang Park to measure sediment sizes, beach gradient, wave height and wave frequency using various fieldwork equipment. Our Elective Geography students on the other hand, are given the opportunity to use weather tracker within the school campus to understand dynamic weather patterns.

These carefully curated tasks allow learners to exercise their Geographical skills and knowledge, while appreciating the real-world application of Geography. We believe that over time, our students will develop a deeper understanding of our changing world and be better prepared for the complexities of the 21st&nbsp;century.
