### **Humanities Talent Development Programme**

##### **River Valley Model United Nations (RVMUN) 2022**

Six of our Secondary Three students took part in the RVMUN 2022, a three-day conference held over Zoom during the March Holidays. In RVMUN 2022, the students took on the role of delegates from countries in the various UN committees. The delegates would debate on issues faced in the current geopolitical context and come to a consensus on the proposed solutions to existing problems.  During the process, the students understood more about the functions of the UN and the challenges it faces. They also sharpened their critical thinking skills through understanding different perspectives and synthesizing information.  Our students also enjoyed forging new friendships with other delegates through the committee debates.

It was certainly an enriching experience to which one student asked, “when is the next conference”?
