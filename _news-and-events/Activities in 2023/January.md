#### Teach the Child Programme ####

**3-6 Jan** - WRS started off the new year with exciting activities that focused on ensuring our students start their year on the right foot. Activities were designed so that the school could set and communicate high expectations and impart life skills and values essential for holistic learning. Ample opportunities were also given for teachers and students to foster and/or strengthen positive relationships.

**Secondary 1s** were oriented to their new surroundings under the care of capable Secondary 4 Student Leaders, who were given the opportunity to design the Orientation Programme. These include a walk-about around the school, introduction to the school values and singing of the school song. Students were also gifted a Student Handbook by the school to not only help students find out more about the school, but to develop their organizational skills.

Similarly, the **Secondary 3s** were also oriented to their new form teachers as well as new classmates. They experienced the Learning for Life Programme (LLP) which focusses on Student Leadership Development through involvement in the Community. Through the activities, students learn more about themselves and develop leadership behaviours which are modelled on The Leadership Challenge Framework, a framework which the school adopts for its development of student leaders.

**Secondary 2s** and **the graduating cohort** focused on reconnecting with one another and forging a stronger class identity.

The **Graduating cohort** also got the opportunity to learn from the experiences of alumni and visit an Institute of Higher Learning to make informed decisions about their future. We were happy to welcome back, among many alumni, Ms Thin Yanlin (Class of 2020) who shared her experience of coming back as a student in Secondary 5 to take on the O-Level Examination.

We wish our Class of 2022 all the best and hope they bring with them the 3 school values (Responsibility, Respect and Resilience) as they move onward with their future endeavours.

#### Chinese New Year Celebrations ####

20 Jan – WRS was abound with festive spirit as we welcome the Year of the Rabbit. After a 2-year hiatus, we went out in full swing to the neighbourhood to spread festive cheer by giving out oranges to residents near the school in an event we call ‘Community Morning’. We were happy to be joined by Ms Mariam Jaafar, Grassroots Advisor to Woodlands GRO for this event.

Class 4R6 hosted a group of 22 senior citizens who are beneficiaries of Lion Befrienders, which aims to provide friendship and care for seniors to age in place with community participation, enabling them to enjoy meaningful and enriching lives. Students quickly broke the ice through meaningful interactions during brunch and engaged the seniors through jigsaw puzzles that they produced themselves.

Upon return to school, students, staff and our guests from Lions Befrienders were treated to an exciting line-up of performances in a concert organised by the Chinese Language Department. Apart from performances by the Concert Band, Choir, Chinese Dance, Modern Dance, there was also an inter-class mascot competition. An exhilarating lion dance ended the ceremony for all.
