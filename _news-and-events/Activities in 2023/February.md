### 2NT ITE Visit (EIP)

**6 & 16 Feb** – Class 2R7 became the first batch of students to visit ITE College Central under the Experience ITE Programme (EIP). It enables students to experience what it is like to learn at ITE, giving them a taste of the learning environment, range of Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) and student facilities available. Through the two visits, students got to try out a variety of fun and practical projects that help instill interests in skills and build aptitude while giving them exposure them to options for future careers in skills-related professions. It was indeed an eye-opening experience for our students!

### Total Defence Week

**13 – 17 Feb** – A myriad of learning experiences was organised to impart in students the value of collective responsibility towards keeping Singapore a safe and strong country.

Throughout the week, students developed a greater understanding of how they can play their part towards Total Defence.

Our uniformed groups – National Cadet Corps (NCC), National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) -- put up booths to educate their peers on the 6 pillars of Total Defence.![](/images/Total%20Def%20Week.jpg)
Important lessons on gratitude and perseverance were also imparted when little luxuries that were often taken for granted, like electricity and good food, were taken away.

Through the issuance of a ration coupon, they were only eligible for one serving of wartime food like plain rice, red bean soup or tapioca soup during recess.

On the actual Total Defence Day, students and staff were reminded again of our collective responsibility in keeping Singapore safe through an engaging re-enactment of the Japanese Occupation and our Vice- principal’s deliverance of this year’s Total Defence Day message. Male teachers from Uniformed Groups proudly donned their uniforms for the occasion while female teachers were in blue and green.

Our NCDCC and NPCC cadets were also invited to showcase Total Defence exhibits to educate their younger peers at Wellington Primary School. It was a meaningful collaboration, and one which gave our students the opportunity to build confidence and find their purpose in engaging the community.

It was indeed an enriching learning experience for everyone.

In WRS, We Keep Singapore Strong!


### eXperiential Week

**20- 24 Feb -** eXperiential Week (Week X) is a highly anticipated week where learning goes beyond the classroom. During Week X, students experience meaningful, authentic, hands-on and
out-of-classroom curricular experiences that help them not only to discover themselves but also develop their cognitive flexibility, creativity and problem-solving skills. 

Of course, students were also given opportunities to spend time with their teachers and classmates through self-initiated class bonding activities that were sure to create lasting memories for years to come. 

Check out the highlights from the different levels. 

**Secondary 1**

The Secondary 1s certainly had an enriching experience in the subjects of English Language, History, Nutrition & Food Science as well as Character & Citizenship Education (CCE). Through a learning journey to Edible Garden City, students became more aware of the role they can play by growing their own food. During the Funvee Open Top Bus Tour, students became tourists for a day to experience local attractions. Teachers ditched their formal wear to become more casual tour guides to help students appreciate Singapore’s heritage and culture.

To build confidence and communication skills, students attended a 1-day Public Speaking Workshop where they learnt not only how to become effective communicators, but also how to plan and structure their responses. 

Their ability to communicate and participate in social settings were also applied in the activities organised during their Learning for Life (Student Leadership Development through Involvement in the Community Programme) and Cyberwellness workshops where students deepen their understanding of what it means to lead themselves. 

**Secondary 2**

If you ask any alumni of WRS, many of them would certainly mention the Character & Citizenship Education (CCE) Camp as one of the highlights of their time here. Through camp activities, students deepen their ability to manage themselves and their relationships with others. During camp, students also went on a learning journey to the National Museum of Singapore, learnt how to play archery and experienced an unforgettable campfire session with their cohort.

Students also got to choose among workshops like Clay Modelling, Manga Art, Sand Animation and Design using 3-Dimensional pens to enhance their aesthetic development.

**Secondary 3**

The Secondary 3 certainly worked hard and played hard during Week X to develop their self-management and relationship management skills. Through the Positive Intelligence Workshop, students learnt how to strengthen their mental fitness by shifting the power from their negative selves to their positive selves. Through a trip to NERF Action Xperience and Sentosa for the Sandcastle Challenge, students were given the opportunities to lead and forge better relationships with their peers.

**Graduating Cohort**

Secondary 4E and 5O various activities were carefully organised to prepare our graduating cohort for their post-secondary education and beyond. Students from the graduating cohort who will be taking their O-Level Examination this year were given the choice to select from various self-improvement workshops – on motivation or study skills – which they felt fit them best. 

To gain exposure to various industries, students were also given the autonomy to choose companies which they were interested in. Students visited companies like 3M, Laselle College of the Arts, SHATEC, ABB and Maritime Port Authority to engage with industry professionals and find out more about possible career pathways.  
Through an Interview Preparation Workshop, students were also given the opportunity to don on their best formal attire and acquire feedback on their performance during interviews. 

Through this, we hope that they would gain confidence and be equipped with the necessary skills to make the best impression.

Experiential learning for students from the graduating cohort who are taking their N-Level Examination was more hands-on as they embarked on the goal of a showcase for their teachers. Students got to select an elective module of choice – from Sports & Fitness, Culinary Arts, Hospitality and Digital Marketing, and worked on a 3-day project to equip themselves with the necessary skills. On showcase day, teachers were treated to a delicious 3-course meal with mocktails and gourmet coffee, demonstrations of sports activities as well as original video content. Impressive, indeed!

### Bahas 4PM – Malay Debate Competition

**20 & 25 Feb** – Our Secondary 4 Malay students took part in the annual National Schools Debate Competition hosted by Bahas4PM on 20 February. With 2 out of 3 wins for the preliminaries, our students successfully made it to the quarter finals! During the quarter finals on 25 February, WRS went up against Dunman Secondary School but lost by a small margin. 

We were really impressed by the grit shown by our students and their achievements and lessons learnt will pave the way for more of their juniors to take on this challenge next year!
