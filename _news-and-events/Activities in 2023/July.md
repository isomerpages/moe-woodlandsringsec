#### Racial Harmony Week 
Racial Harmony Day this year took a different spin as we commemorated this important day a week earlier. You might ask why. We had good reason to do so. The students and teachers of our twinning school, Yayasan Sekolah Kristen Indonesia (YSKI), Semarang, made a visit to our school in Term 3 Week 3 so we decided it would be most fitting to show them what Racial Harmony is all about.

The theme for this year is ‘Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic’. The student committee hinged the event on the following objectives: To value racial harmony, to appreciate our cultural heritage and to celebrate our diversity.

Throughout the week students partook in the pledge-taking in the morning by listening to or reciting the National Pledge in not just English Language but our Mother Tongue Languages as well. There were also different cultural activities run by the student committee and the Parents Support Group! Students even got to wear their traditional outfits to school and some classes got to interact with our guests from Indonesia during lessons. 

Many friendships between students from both countries were formed. We look forward to more such opportunities to build bridges of understanding and appreciation of our diversity.
