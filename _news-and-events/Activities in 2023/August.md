#### NSF Engagement (CCE programme) 
The Full-time National Servicemen (NSF) Engagement is a programme that aims to help students understand the importance of National Service to Singapore. This is an annual event run by the CCE Department.

On 3 August 2023, we had the privilege of welcoming back two former students Nigel Goh and Rayner Ng, who graduated in 2018, to share their experiences in National Service. Both of them were attached to the police force during their National Service days and are now pursuing further education.

Nigel served in the Woodlands Division to mainly manage the training of up to 2,200 reservists while Rayner was posted to the Airport Police Division. They shared some key takeaways such as the importance of teamwork and discipline when working with others as well as empathy and patience with members of the public and their co-workers. Indeed, these are important life lessons and words of wisdom for their juniors!

Letâ€™s take a look at how they spent their day at WRS!
