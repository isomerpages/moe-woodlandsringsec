#### WRS’ First ‘No Schoolbag Day’ 
**2 May** – WRS joined the global initiative of ‘No Backpack Day’ to raise awareness for students without access to backpacks due to poverty. Our students rose to the challenge, carrying their school supplies in unconventional ways, showcasing their resilience and creativity. 'Backpacks' included pots, pet carriers, makeshift baskets, boxes, pails, fans, and stools.

As we walked in the shoes of the less fortunate, we learned to appreciate life's little luxuries. We thank our students for their enthusiasm and staff for their support in making this event meaningful. No Schoolbag Day teaches empathy, compassion, and social responsibility, inspiring positive change. We at WRS will continue to inspire a more inclusive and compassionate environment for everyone.
