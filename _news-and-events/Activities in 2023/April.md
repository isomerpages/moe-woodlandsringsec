#### Spring Cleaning Homes this Hari Raya with Woodlands Youth Network
**15 Apri**l – In the spirit of giving back to the community, Woodlands Youth Network invited our school to participate in a joint project to clean and paint homes in the Woodlands area for the upcoming Hari Raya celebrations. Our student volunteers joined hands with Grassroots Leaders and students from other schools to visit and assist with the cleaning and painting of homes in need.

The project provided an excellent opportunity for students to show gratitude for their blessings and contribute to the community. It was an eye-opening experience for many students who had not seen first-hand the living conditions of some families in the area.

During the project, the students learned valuable life skills such as teamwork, communication, and empathy. They also had the opportunity to interact with different people and learn about the diverse cultures within their community. This joint project was not only beneficial for the community but also for the personal development of our students.

The project was a success, and the feedback from the residents was overwhelmingly positive. Many expressed their gratitude for the assistance and for the opportunity to interact with the students.

WRS looks forward to future collaborations with Woodlands Youth Network that will continue to benefit the community and provide opportunities for our students to grow and develop. We encourage all students to actively seek opportunities to give back to the community and make a positive impact in the lives of others.
