#### Secondary 2s emerged 2nd place in Rentas Pantas
**11 March** - We are proud to announce that our Secondary 2 students participated in the annual National Malay Language Amazing Race Challenge, or ‘Rentas Pantas’ and emerged as runners-up! It was a fulfilling and enriching session for all the participants as they learned more about their roots through fun and interactive learning stations situated around NTU NIE.

The Amazing Race Challenge is an annual event that aims to promote the use and understanding of the Malay language among students. The challenge requires students to work in teams to complete a series of tasks that test their knowledge of the language, culture, and history of the Malay community.

Our team performed exceptionally well, and we congratulate them on their achievement. Their hard work and dedication paid off, and they have set an excellent example for their peers to follow.

Participating in events like ‘Rentas Pantas’ is an excellent way for students to learn about their cultural heritage and develop a deeper appreciation for their roots. We are proud of our students for taking up the challenge and demonstrating their passion for the Malay language and culture. Congratulations once again to our Secondary 2 team on their
remarkable achievement!

The Sports Carnival provided an excellent opportunity for students to showcase their skills and talent in various sports. From basketball to hockey, volleyball to badminton, students had a chance to learn and play different games with their peers. The carnival also had friendly competitions that helped the students develop their sportsmanship skills while having fun.

The event was not just about sports; it was also about team bonding. Through various team-building activities, students were able to interact and connect with their teammates on a deeper level. This helped create a strong sense of community and unity among the members of the different sports co-curricular activities.

Overall, the Sports Carnival was a great success. It provided an excellent opportunity for students to come together, learn, play, and bond with each other. 
We look forward to next year’s event!

#### World Water Week 
**22 March** – At WRS, the Environment Education Committee was determined to raise awareness about the importance of water conservation during World Water Day. Throughout the week, a series of activities were organised to promote daily water-saving habits and the concept of water footprint among staff and students.

Among the activities were setting up a water conservation booth, playing educational card games during recess, and enlightening presentations during morning assembly. The highlight of the week was a water-rationing exercise that demonstrated the need to conserve water. During recess, students were limited to washing their hands with water in pails instead of the usual taps at the canteen sink.

Even the teachers showed their support for the national water conservation initiative by dressing up in various shades of blue. The initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of water conservation and encourages people to take simple steps towards saving water in their daily lives.

Through these activities, all members of our school community are one step closer to becoming responsible consumers of water. As we continue to work towards promoting water conservation, we hope that everyone will join us in our efforts to protect our planet's most precious resource.



#### Secondary 1s get their PLDs
**27 March** - Our school is thrilled to announce that our Secondary 1 students have received their Personal Learning Device (PLD) i.e. their iPads, under the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP). This initiative empowers students with new ways of learning that are interactive, immersive, and fun.

The Personalised Digital Learning Programme is designed to complement the traditional classroom experience and provide students with a personalised learning experience that caters to their individual learning needs. With the help of iPads, we hope our Secondary 1 students can learn at their own pace and in their preferred styles; and acquire essential life skills such as organising their personal learning resources, managing their schedules as well as effective note-taking. Teachers can also track their progress and provide timely feedback to ensure that they stay on track through interactive games and online platforms.

We believe that the PDLP will revolutionise the way our students learn and prepare them for the challenges of the future. We are excited to see how our students will embrace this new digital landscape and use technology to enhance their learning and become future-ready leaders.
