### **July**
##### **Student Leaders Council (SLC) Presidential Election 2021**
With the experiences gathered from our inaugural SLC Executive Committee (Ex-Co) Election 2020, we did the selection of the eight members for the new Ex-Co team prior to putting them up for Presidential Election.

The eight Presidential candidates then did a 1-minute campaign video and a poster each to introduce themselves and their passion to serve to the students and staff. Through this election, we hope that the Ex-Co members can build confidence and take accountability for their actions and, at the same time, increases their visibility to all students and staff of WRSS.

By empowering the students as voters, we want to increase their level of engagement in knowing that their voices are heard and valued. Our hope is that students will enter as citizens into the community with knowledge, understanding and a sense of empowerment.

Even as new waves of uncertainty arose during the Phase 2 heightened alert period, we proceeded with the SLC Presidential Election 2021 on the 25 May 2021, using the e-Voting system – yet another quick adaptation to new situation.

So who is the newly elected President of the 15th Student Leaders Council? Stay tune to our Student Leaders Investiture in Term 3 Week 5!
