### **August**
##### **Racial Harmony Week 2021**
Although there is no ethic costumes and physical games this year, our spirit is not dampened by the SMM measures. Commemorating Racial Harmony Day took shape with a different form. Pledge-taking in 4 different languages, decoration of the corridor based on the theme ‘Common Space, Connected Communities’ and a Kahoot Challenge among classes. These activities were planned by the student leaders with an aim in mind. That is to provide opportunity for everyone in WRSS to come together and celebrate our shared space and strengthen the trust and friendship among us.

##### **National Day 2021**
The theme this year was “Together, Our Singapore Spirit!” and the student leaders planned an exciting day to rally the school around our strong Singaporean identity and trademark ‘can-do’ attitude! Firstly, the exciting livestream concert featured the inaugural WRSS Fashion Walk of Fame that highlighted our students’ dynamism through their creative ways of representing the Singapore spirit. Other highlights included how the school united to perform the WRSS Wave, a student-created hand-clap routine, before showcasing the life-sized National Day collage that featured our students’ aspirations for Singapore – truly, one drop in the sea is all it takes to set a wave in motion!
