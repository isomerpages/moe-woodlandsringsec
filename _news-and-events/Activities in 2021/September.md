##### **TASAD Celebrations 2021: Thank You ‘Cher!**
This year’s TASAD celebrations was titled “Thank You ‘Cher”, a nation-wide theme introduced by MOE to laud the efforts of school staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. In WRS, every staff in the school is affectionately known as “cher” which explains why we call it Teachers and Staff Appreciation Day (TASAD).

To show their appreciation for the staff, the student leaders launched the message writing booth, where everyone could pen their appreciation for individual staff. During the TASAD celebrations, the day started with a staff party organized by the staff well-being committee. After which, everyone enjoyed the Zoom concert, which included an interactive segment, and the class parties organised by the class leaders. It was a heart-warming day which marked the end of term 3.
