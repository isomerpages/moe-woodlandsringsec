### **September**
##### **TASAD Celebrations 2021: Thank You ‘Cher!**
This year’s TASAD celebrations was titled “Thank You ‘Cher”, a nation-wide theme introduced by MOE to laud the efforts of school staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. In WRS, every staff in the school is affectionately known as “cher” which explains why we call it Teachers and Staff Appreciation Day (TASAD).

To show their appreciation for the staff, the student leaders launched the message writing booth, where everyone could pen their appreciation for individual staff. During the TASAD celebrations, the day started with a staff party organized by the staff well-being committee. After which, everyone enjoyed the Zoom concert, which included an interactive segment, and the class parties organised by the class leaders. It was a heart-warming day which marked the end of term 3.

##### **Water Conservation**
The annual SEC-StarHub School Green Awards (SGA) is a voluntary environmental programme that serves as a platform for schools to develop and showcase their environmental efforts. In addition, it is a platform that reviews the schools’ efforts and initiatives within the campus concerning various environmental aspects and key projects focusing on raising awareness, advocating sustainability and creating real impact.

Every year our school carries out activities in which students are given the opportunity to embark on different environmental programmes to instill a greater sense of awareness towards environmental sustainability. This year we are proud to have achieved the “Yellow Flame Awards”, given to schools with an overall of at least 80%.
