### **May**
##### **Concert Band SYF Achievement**
The Concert Band recently participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation. We sent two teams comprising students from across all four levels and were pleased to have achieved a Certificate of Accomplishment. Our bands performed a variety of pieces such as “Korean Folk Rhapsody”, a version of the Korean folk song “_Arirang”_ and other arrangements by our local composers such as “Folk Song March” – a play on local community songs. Kudos to our Lower Secondary students who managed to step up despite them not having the same level of rigorous training and experience as their seniors. It was certainly a rewarding experience, and a heartening reward for the resilience and hard work put in despite the challenges we faced of being unable to meet for combined practice.

##### **Chinese Dance SYF Achievement**
The Chinese Dancers achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment in the SYF Arts Presentation 2021. The girls rose to the challenge of meeting the safe management measures. The girls portrayed the love of life and the positive outlook in life beautifully throughout the dance. This achievement is testament to the team’s dedication and passion for dance.

##### **Choir SYF Achievement**
2021 has been an unwonted yet valuable period for the Choir! With the SMM in place, we were only able to practice in groups of no more than 5, which undoubtedly made us miss each other and the rich harmonies we had relished in the past. We stuck to our little groups and continued to believe in each other. After months of hard and heart work, we were astonished and delighted when we heard our recording for SYF.  Finally, the deeply comforting and alluring harmonies enchanted our ears once more.

(There is no central grading for Choir SYF this year. Special consideration is given in light of the ongoing pandemic.)

##### **Guzheng Ensemble SYF Achievement**
The Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation for our Guzheng Ensemble took place on 20 April 2021. The biggest change that the students have encountered is the learning experience. With fewer in-person sessions in 2020, our teachers and instructors used creative ways to conduct synchronous and asynchronous lessons. For instance, not only did the ensemble get to rehearse together, students could still enjoy the one-to-one coaching with our instructors. When sessions in 2021 resumed, the ensemble was eager to get in the swing of things to bond and learn together. Our ensemble is happy to announce that they have achieved the Certificate of Accomplishment at the festival.

##### **WRSS e-career fair 2021**
On the last day of Term 2, May 28, 2021, Secondary 2, 3, 4 and 5 students attended the WRSS e-Careers Fair where they interacted with professionals from the different career clusters. The professionals shared their personal experiences and thoughts on their careers and this helped to broaden students’ perspectives on the respective industries. With a clearer understanding of the different industries, we hope that our students will be able to select the subject combinations that are more related to the courses they would like to pursue in the future and make well-informed post-secondary choices.
