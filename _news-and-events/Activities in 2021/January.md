### **January**
On 26 January 2021, our Secondary Two Normal Technical students attended an Experience ITE Programme (EIP) organised by Institute of Education College Central. The EIP is specially designed for secondary school students to experience ITE’s Hands-On, Minds-On, Hearts-On TM education and be immersed in the authentic learning environments offered by ITE

We were warmly welcomed at the Experience ITE Centre by Mr Manokara, the Experience ITE Centre Co-ordinator, who shared about the courses and facilities available at ITE Central.

#### **College Tour**
The students took a tour around the College to look at the environment. Our WRSS alumnus shared about her experience at ITE Central in Fitness Training.

During the tour, students were also shown the Boeing 737-301 located at ITE Central which provides students a hands-on opportunity with aircraft maintenance and other related courses.

##### **School of Business Services**

Students were introduced to the know-how of businesses and the importance of providing good service to customers. During the hands-on activity, students had the opportunities to be cabin crew members where they made flight announcements to welcome their peers on board the Experience ITE Central flight.

##### **School of Electronics & Info-Comm Technology**
Students were introduced to the gaming and exploratory approaches used during lessons for the School of Electronics & Info-Comm Technology. In their small groups, students directed and produced a movie to showcase their experience at ITE Central. After filming the scenes, they edited and produced it into a short movie.

#### **Teach the Child Programme (TTCP)**
The “Teach the Child Programme” has been a signature programme in the school for many years. Instead of rushing into academic learning, time was set aside to ensure a smooth transition for all students holistically into the new year. The activities planned enabled students to reconnect with the school leaders, Year Heads, their form teachers as well as their friends. This is also an important platform to enable the school leaders and form teachers to set and communicate expectations, build positive relationships and to teach life skills and reiterate the importance of values, attitude and SE competencies as the foundation for learning.

The school welcomed the new batch of Secondary 1 students through an orientation programme which includes a day camp planned by the Secondary 4 student leaders.

For the Secondary 2 students, more time was allocated to developing a deeper sense of belonging to the class. The newly appointed student councillors took charge of running games for their classmates in the Class Challenge, while the form teachers engaged the students in a Domino competition. Students also got creative as they spray painted their classroom with chalkboard spray and wrote motivational quotes on the wall.

The Secondary 3 students started the year by learning and experiencing one of the practices of The Leadership Challenge – Inspire a Shared Vision. The activities provided them with an opportunity to get to know their new classmates better and build an identity as a class. One of their highlights was creating a class mascot using clay, which embodies the values of what the class aspires to be.

The graduating classes put on their creative hats as they drew motivational quotes on their walls and painted their class names on canvases. These activities enabled the classes to create a motivating and conducive learning environment that would hopefully bring out the best in each of them to do well for the year. As usual, one of the highlights for the students is the customised alumni talks for each stream. Former students came back to share their struggles and strategies that they adopted when they were students taking the national examinations. The Secondary 2 and graduating students also had the opportunity to visit the Healthcare Exhibition Bus, which is the Ministry of Health’s initiative to promote nursing and allied health professions as careers of choice.
