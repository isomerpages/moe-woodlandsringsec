### **October**
##### **Technically Normal Day 2020**
An abnormal school year calls for a not-so-normal end to it – technically speaking! 3T7 Torimodosu, the organisers for this year’s Technically Normal Day, collaborated with student leaders to hold the school’s first ever Interclass Tabletop Games Competition as part of the event – so much for all the missed opportunities for staff and students to bond this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic! The event was capped off with the usually highly-anticipated online showcase of our talented students and shared memories for the year. _Sayonara, 2020!_

##### **Post-exam Activities**
The end of the year examinations were finally over and students looked forward to learning in a different manner. This has been a very challenging year for all, and the post exam activities offered a good respite from the COVID-19 situation, encouraging students to focus on other postive aspects. From cultural appreciation to environmental education; from aesthetics workshops to executive functioning skills courses; from enhancing intellectual capacity to building social-emotional competencies, these meaningful activities engaged students as part of their holistic development. The last day of school, traditionally Technically Normal Day, might have been done differently this time round but the school year certainly ended on a good note.
