### **July**
##### **Racial Harmony Week**

Racial Harmony Week (RH Week) this year took a different spin. With social distancing measures in place due to Covid-19, activities were conducted in the classroom. Even social media has played a role in getting students connected to this important event in the WRSS calendar.

The theme for this year is ‘Multicultural Singapore’. The RH student committee hinged the event on the following objective: To ignite curiosity of, encourage proactiveness in understanding and be appreciative of each other’s race, language and religion.

Throughout the week beginning 13 July, students listened in to presentations during morning assembly by student leaders. They shared about the interesting beliefs and practices of different races and religions in Singapore. Students also learnt to and greeted their teachers and friends in different Mother Tongue languages. The highlight of the week was on 17 July. On this day, Level Activities and Citizenship Education (CE) Conversations were conducted in class by Form Teachers. A gathering in Singapore is not complete unless there is food. Students and their Form Teachers enjoyed a ‘Kenduri Kelas’ lunch in their own classrooms, catered by the canteen vendors. The school was apart but somehow still together!
