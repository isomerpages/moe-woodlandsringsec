### **April**

##### **Social Engagement during Full Home-Based Learning**

Going into full HBL meant disruptions to our daily school routines. It meant that we had to get used to a new norm of learning from home and being away from one another. However, social distancing does not mean relational distancing. With that, an Instagram account (@wrssdaily) was created to stay in contact with our students. The aim of the account is to engage, entertain and empower our students as they navigate through the challenges of being at home and studying online. We know our students have what it takes to rise to this challenge and will emerge more resilient and self-directed.

Through the account, familiar programmes and faces are brought into the students’ homes. Videos for Motivation Monday, interviews with our Principal Mrs Ng and Takehiro (our Student Council President), students’ work from different HBL tasks, memes and more can be found on the account.

One of the highlights on the account is a video done by one of the graduating classes. They decided to put together a video to show their appreciation to the front liners who are working hard to fight Covid-19. The video can be found at this [link](https://www.instagram.com/tv/B_cX8blht3O/)

##### **21st International Elementz Fair**
Our budding researchers, as part of our Science Talent Development Programme, took part in the Annual Science Fair, organised by Anderson Serangoon Junior College on 14 and 15 April 2020. The Fair received a total of 111 project submissions, including from overseas institutions from Vietnam and Thailand.  

Despite being confronted with the challenges during the Circuit Breaker period due to Covid-19 and needing to adapt to a modified format for the Fair, our teams did not disappoint. Two teams received the Gold and Merit Awards respectively.

We would like to thank our team of teachers (Mr Jeremy See, Mr Neo and Mr John Toh) who mentored our students in the conduct of their experiments, preparation of poster and video for submission.
