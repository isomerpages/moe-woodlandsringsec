### **September**
##### **Student Archivist Project 2020**

Eight Secondary 1 students took part in the Student Archivist Project organised by the National Museum of Singapore (NMS) from February to September 2020. As part of the project, the students are required to interview a member of the Merdeka generation about his / her experiences with housing in Singapore during the 1960s, and produce an audio / video recording of the interview.

The students were split into 2 teams, namely:

Team 1<br>
1\) Peh Shan Yuan, Leroy of Class 1-4<br>
2\) Matthew Lau Wei Cheng of Class 1-2<br>
3\) Nina Syamira Binti Wira of Class 1-6<br>
4\) Chan Guo Quan, Dominic of Class 1-6

Team 2<br>
1\) Chincholkar Shraddha Ravikiran of Class 1-3<br>
2\) Kate Thanthar Myat Noe Oo of Class 1-1<br>
3\) Muhammad Lutfil Firdaus Bin Abdullah of Class 1-5<br>
4\) Anika Kalgude of Class 1-5

The NMS has commended the students for their efforts in carrying out the interviews virtually. In particular, Team 2â€™s work was selected for professional filming by the NMS. The production will be featured in future NMS programmes.
