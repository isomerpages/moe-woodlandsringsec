On the 3 February 2020, Monday, the Guzheng Ensemble performed at the annual Huayi Chinese Festival of Arts series of performances. The event, entitled Passion in Strings, was presented at the Concourse Esplanade. The school’s guzheng instructor, Ms Yvonne Tay was invited by the Esplanade, to showcase her students.

The first item the ensemble performed was popular Chinese New Year number 大地回春. The second rendition was Stay With Me, a contemporary Korean piece by members of K-pop boy band, EXO. Our students played to an appreciative and captivated audience.

These pieces were selected by the students. They aptly expressed their youthfulness and their hope for a better tomorrow. Let’s wish them all the very best in 2020!

##### **Hoop Activity**

The PE Department’s Vitality.In.Me (VIM) Programme started off the year with an enrichment activity, Hoop Fitness on 4 February 2020. The aim of the activity is to motivate students to improve their own fitness through physical activities. The session started out with Zumba as a warm up activity then the use of the hula hoop for arm toning and finally, combining aerobics with the use of hula hoop.

The students were generally happy, engaged and having a lots of fun! However, the session was challenging as the participants had to do aerobics while hula hooping at the same time. The trainers were very forthcoming in giving feedback to those who had difficulties. On the whole, the session was a great success as the participants burnt calories while picking up many new skills.

##### **Total Defence Day 2020**

This year’s TDD commemoration is very timely because with the coronavirus outbreak, we remind ourselves that Singapore’s defence is in our hands. It is a clear reminder that our safety and security as a nation, as one people, is something that we should not take lightly. We are equally vulnerable, like many countries. Therefore, we cannot take what we currently have for granted. And that it takes both individual effort and collective team work to continue to keep Singapore strong.

Despite the restrictions and numerous changes, the organizing committee ensured that learning continued through the various activities planned for the week. Students were exposed to the 6 pillars of defence through a range of hands-on activities planned by the three uniformed groups. NCC booth focused on psychological and military defense, NPCC booth focused on economic and digital defence while NCDCC booth focused on civil and social defence. Woodlands NPC brought their fast response car into the school and also set up display panels with SG secure messages. On Thursday, the school implemented the Wipe Down routine. This is to remind us to practice the school value of Responsibility – over our personal hygiene and to be socially responsible and considerate towards others who will use the table after us. This is certainly a reminder that every small action matter.
