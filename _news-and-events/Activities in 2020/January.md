2020 Bravissimoxi (3)

The Symphonic Band performed at Kampung Admiralty on Sunday, 19 January as part of the Lunar New Celebrations organised by the Woodlands Grassroots Organisation. This year’s concert – Bravissimo! XI – featured a variety of songs ranging from familiar Chinese New Year pieces like ‘恭喜恭喜 _Gong Xi Gong Xi_’ and ‘贺新年 _He Xin Nian_’ to other popular music by various artistes. The performance was a way for the band to give back to the community and showcase the music that our students have worked hard to prepare over the past few months. Through this performance, the band also explored various types of music, such as having a piece which combined a solo violinist playing together with the band and having various ensemble performances. It was certainly an enriching and unforgettable experience for everyone.
