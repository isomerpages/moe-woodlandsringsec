2020 Bravissimoxi (3)

The Symphonic Band performed at Kampung Admiralty on Sunday, 19 January as part of the Lunar New Celebrations organised by the Woodlands Grassroots Organisation. This year’s concert – Bravissimo! XI – featured a variety of songs ranging from familiar Chinese New Year pieces like ‘恭喜恭喜 _Gong Xi Gong Xi_’ and ‘贺新年 _He Xin Nian_’ to other popular music by various artistes. The performance was a way for the band to give back to the community and showcase the music that our students have worked hard to prepare over the past few months. Through this performance, the band also explored various types of music, such as having a piece which combined a solo violinist playing together with the band and having various ensemble performances. It was certainly an enriching and unforgettable experience for everyone.

##### **Teach the Child Programme(TTCP)2020**

In WRS, we begin our academic year with ‘Teach the Child Programme’(TTCP). Since 2010, in line with the school’s culture of care, we have put processes in place to ensure a smooth transition for all students holistically into a new year. Instead of rushing into the teaching of subject matter, the programme enables the school leaders and form teachers to set and communicate expectations, build positive relationships and to teach life skills and reiterate the importance of values, attitude and SE competencies as the foundation for learning.

The Secondary 1 students went through an orientation programme and the inaugural Sec 1 Camp, planned by the Secondary 4 student leaders. For the Secondary 2 students, more time was allocated to developing a deeper sense of belonging to the class. The newly appointed student councillors took charge of running games for their classmates in the Class Challenge, while the form teachers engaged the students with a Domino competition.

The Secondary 3 students started the year by learning and experiencing the last two practices in the Leadership Challenge – Inspire a Shared Vision and Challenge the Process. Being new to their classes, many of the activities provided them with an opportunity to get to know their new classmates better and build an identity as a class.

The school tour and some administrative sessions were also carried out to allow better understanding of the physical and psychosocial environment, and the school’s expectations.
