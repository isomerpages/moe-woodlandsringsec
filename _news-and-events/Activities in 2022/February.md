### **February**
##### **Total Defence Day**
Total Defence Day commemoration is one of the staples for the remembrance of the history of Singapore. The activities for this year included class discussions about digital threats, and exhibitions put up by our Uniformed Groups. To educate the school community about the 6 pillars of Total Defence, Mrs Ng delivered a speech from Dr Ng Eng Hen, and student leaders also shared their perspectives. The theme Together We Keep Singapore Strong may be the same as that of 2021 but it continues to be a relevant call for solidarity this year as her people soldier on against the impact of challenges faced by Singapore during the ongoing pandemic.
