### **January**
##### **Teach the Child Programme (TTCP)**
We kickstarted the year with the “Teach the Child Programme” (TTCP). Throughout the week, time was set aside to ensure a smooth transition for all students holistically into the new year. The activities planned enabled students to reconnect with the school leaders, Year Heads, their form teachers as well as their friends.

Different level activities were planned to enable students to build a sense of identity and belonging to the class and the school. Activities ranged from the orientation programme for Secondary 1 to the Class Challenge and Scavenger Hunt for the Secondary 2 to the Learning for Life Programme for the Secondary 3 and Class Bonding Day and Alumni Talks for the graduating cohort.

##### **O-Level Results Day**
Our Class of 2021 collected their GCE O level results and we are happy to share that there is a high percentage of students with four or more subject passes. Congratulations to our Seniors!

In a year full of challenges and disruptions, the cohort had risen to the occasion and performed well across the subjects! Learning is a lifelong journey. We hope that our students will continue to find the motivation and passion to learn, so as to achieve their goals.

At Woodlands Ring Secondary School, with the focus on developing the strength of character and inculcation of values, we are confident our graduates will overcome future challenges with tenacity and perseverance.

This is an important milestone in your education, but your pursuit of knowledge continues. In whichever path you take, we believe you will carry on to learn for life. Wishing them all the best for their future endeavours!
