### **March**
##### **2022 Experiential Week (Week X)**
We kickstarted Term 2 with our signature Week X, a week of experiential learning. Throughout the week, students had the opportunity to experience authentic learning both in the classroom as well as out of the classroom. A more relaxed national posture also enabled us to resume learning journeys and other cohort-based activities. Student voice was a key consideration when planning for the activities. This autonomy to choose their preferred activities resulted in a multitude of experiences and learning for the students. Apart from the rich learning, students also had the opportunity to deepen their sense of identity and belonging as a class. Here are some of the highlights for the different levels.

**Highlights for our Secondary 1 cohort**<br>
Being the first journey out of school in more than 2 years, the joy of learning out-of-school excited everyone. Not only did our students immerse themselves in the history of Singapore explained by our Humanities teachers on an open-top Hippo bus in the Civic District, they also had the chance to experience the thrill and excitement of picking up a new sport, inline skating. 

It was also a first in many other ways; our students learned for the first time collaboratively on their iPads through the Arts and Math Trail, wheel-throw at a pottery workshop and our newly minted class leaders also stepped up for the first time to co-plan their first Class Bonding activity with their Form Teachers.  For many students, their breakthrough came as they spoke in front of their class to share their ideas at the Public Speaking Workshop too.

With so many opportunities to learn joyfully and dynamically, it is no wonder a student quipped in anticipation “Cher, can we have this every time?”.

**Highlights for our Secondary 2 cohort**<br>

Our Secondary 2 students got themselves engaged by starting off with the Aesthetics Programme! Given the choice of two activities out of the four; Sand Animation, Manga Arts, 3D Pen and Saber-do, they participated actively in the activities. Other than the Aesthetic Programme, Arts Trail serves as the additional platform for them to develop visual literacy with increased awareness and aesthetic sensitivity.

In WRS, we believe every student can be developed as a leader, the LLP Workshop served as the fundamental platform for them to learn more about leadership practices and the focuses were “Enable Others to Act” and “Encourage the Heart” from The Leadership Challenge model.

Student-led activities are also intentionally included. Our Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) were given the opportunity to lead and engage their classmates by sharing with them the importance of happiness through activities. 

The highlight of the Week X programme is the 2-day CCE Camp which was planned and executed by our Secondary 3 student leaders. They stepped up and put in effort and time so as to allow their juniors to achieve the optimum learning with fun! Although the camp was held in school, it did not dampen the spirit and experience for our students. Students definitely found meaning in the CCE camp as these activities consisted of learning points such as character building, making sensible choices as a team, having a sense of gratitude and appreciation and developing a strong national identity. As aligned with this year’s camp theme ‘Connecting Hearts, Creating Memories’, we believe they have fostered fond memories and strong bonds through this cohort experience.

**Highlights for our Secondary 3 cohort**<br>
With new leadership opportunities and academic challenges that are likely to confront them this year, our Secondary 3 students started the week with a Growth Mindset workshop. Through the workshop, they learned strategies on the actions they can take to be more effective and focused on their tasks. Like the story of the salmon swimming upstream, they learn that being resilient and consistent in their effort will empower them to be conquerors of challenges. 

On Tuesday, students utilised their strengths to represent their classes in an array of interclass challenges – catered for avid mobile gamers, board-game enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies. Mobile games in teams put their tactical and strategic skills to outplay and outlast their opponents. Board-games like carrom, Boggle and RummyKub brings back the nostalgic air of relaxation and face-to-face interactions among players. The battle for physical supremacy ensued through a traditional game of zero point and contemporary ones like trick-shot penalty shootout and WRS Team Ninja Warrior Challenge. The excitement and competitiveness to secure as many points for their class was evident as they went through the many rounds of games.

 For the rest of the week, the student leaders were engaged in running the Secondary 2 CCE Camp while the rest of the cohort applied their new media literacy skills to complete different online learning tasks.

 **Highlights for our graduating cohort**<br>

Having missed many opportunities over the years because of safe management restrictions, our graduating cohort finally had the opportunity to venture out of school with their classmates through class bonding activities and learning journeys to different Institutes of Higher Learning (IHL). Students explored the courses and facilities available at ITE Central, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Republic Polytechnic. They gained insights from the lecturers and considered different post-secondary options. 

This year, our Week X programme for the graduating cohort is aligned with our 3C curriculum which combines English and CCE (ECG) curriculum to prepare our students for their post-secondary pathways. In school, our students were exposed to the industry landscape through Career Taster Module where they had hands-on experience on the industry of their choice. Following their selection, students were equipped with relevant life skills where they learned how to ace their interviews, manage their finances, groom themselves and stay motivated through various workshops. 

As a finale to what they had learned over the past week and during their 3C curriculum, our students showed up in school with their career outfit and shared their career choices with their peers. Our WRS alumni also returned and shared with their juniors about their hurdles and joys in their respective careers. Our students commemorated the moments with the catered photobooths. We believe that ten years down the road, our students will look back and recall the happy memories that they had forged with their classmates during their times in WRSS with joy.
