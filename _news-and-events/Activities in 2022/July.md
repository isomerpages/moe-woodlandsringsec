Mr Tan also brought another angle of the defence of Singapore into his presentation. He is currently a student at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT). Recently, he interned at the Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA). He has been working closely with his colleagues, to learn about and improve the capabilities of Quad the Robotic Dog.

From his sharing, students better appreciated the importance of using technology in the defence of Singapore. Fascinated? You can read up more about this [here](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/latest-news/spotlight/showcasing-army-tech).
