### **August**
##### **National Day Parade**

Our Uniformed Groups and Symphonic Band were involved in the Woodlands National Day Carnival. Together with students from Evergreen Secondary School, our cadets formed the Guard-of-Honour contingents for the parade while the Band played the national anthem and an array of National Day songs for the concert segment.
