19-22 March — 2018’s eXperential Learning Week (Week ‘X’) saw our students engage in authentic out-of-classroom learning. Our Secondary Ones got to learn more about Singapore’s history through a Hippo Bus tour around the Civic District while other levels got to embark on various Learning Journeys to Institutes of Higher Learning and go through career talks.
