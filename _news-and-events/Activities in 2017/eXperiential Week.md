7-10 March 2017 — The final of week of Term 1 was an exciting one for all students of Woodlands Ring Secondary School students as our school embarked on our annual week of Experiential Learning, or ‘Week X’ for short.  

A highlight of the school calendar, ‘Week X’ aims to give students the opportunity to apply what is learnt in the classroom and exercise responsible decision making. The authentic, experiential and out-of-classroom curricular experiences give our students the chance to develop cognitive flexibility, creativity and complex problem-solving skills. At the same time, students get to bond with their classmates and teachers through enjoyable activities that show them the fun of learning.
