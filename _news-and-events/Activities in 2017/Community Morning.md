27 January –- Woodlands Ring Secondary School transformed into a vibrant sea of red as we prepared for Community Morning, an activity we conduct yearly as part of the Lunar New Year Celebrations where we give out oranges to the residents in our community.  

The school started the celebration with the surprise appearance of our Year Heads, Mr Kheng Kok Seong and Mr Yap Choong Shiong in Gods of Fortune costumes. The parade square buzzed with excitement and laughter as students tried to catch the “blessings” of gold coins thrown out to them by the mascots.

Then, students and teachers got to work, packing over 10,000 oranges to be given out thank the residents in our neighbourhood for their support of the school.

Our students fanned out across the area to distribute oranges to more than 5,000 units, including MINDS and neighbouring schools. They were joined by special guests such as Parents from the Parent Support Group (PSG) and staff and students from the Red House Kindergarten.

Community Morning is an important activity for the students as it not only teaches them gratitude, it also allows them to exercise good interpersonal skills with residents. This will definitely develop them into becoming more confident individuals and active contributors of society.
