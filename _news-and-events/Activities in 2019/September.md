		 Student members from Robotics Club participated in the International World Robot Games held in Bangkok, Thailand from 30 to 31 August 2019. This international competition promotes a great opportunity for technological creativity among students by stimulating their imagination and embrace innovative technology to complete the given task. Our students participated in the Rugby, Search & Rescue and Sumo events. Through the experience, our students learnt to collaborate with one another in co-constructing knowledge and problem solving by integrating their learning to develop the abilities to design, make and code their robots to solve real-life problems. Our students also had the opportunities to think critically and work autonomously in some instances and to work together with teams from other countries, strengthening their collaborative and social skills. Despite intense challenging competition environment, our students had fun competing with their peers from other countries and make as many friends as they can in return. Through their interactions with counterparts, they espoused the three school core values of responsibility, respect and resilience.

Our 2019 edition of the annual Cycling Trail took us on a journey from Pasir Ris Park to Sengkang Riverside Park. Enroute, staff and students had a day filled with learning as we explored an aquarium along Pasir Ris Farmway, Lorong Halus Wetland Kiosk and Coney Island. The non-cyclists embarked on a Walking Trail that included a workshop on carnivorous plants at the lesser known SG Venus Flytrap Community Garden. It was another meaningful adventure that worked the body and the mind.

The day started early for our Secondary Two students as they prepared to embark on a day camp at Pulau Ubin. The mood was a joyful one filled with laughter all around.

The familiar smell of calm and tranquility greeted everyone after a short boat ride. The learning journey started with an introduction about a kampong house. They then immersed themselves in _batik_ painting and eating _roti jala_, what better way to embrace the Malay culture and customs than to do so through food and art!

The day ended with a trip to the Chek Jawa Wetlands where students learnt more about Singapore’s biodiversity.

Dance Fiesta is an annual event where Secondary One students learn and perform the Zumba whereas Secondary Two students perform the Mambo. Students learn the various dance movements during their PE lessons over 10 weeks where they develop a better understanding towards rhythmic movement. The dance module also enables them to express and communicate feelings and ideas through exploration, creation and performance to enjoy and value the benefits of living a physically active and healthy life. The best performing groups from each class showcase their choreography during the dance fiesta

##### **TASAD 2019**

In WRSS, Teachers and Staff Appreciation Day (TASAD) has always been an event where students and parents recognize and acknowledge the efforts and work done by the staff of the school. This year, we celebrated our TASAD 2019 in style! The theme conceptualised by the Student Leaders was First Class – where all staff were treated as V.I.Ps on board a plane while travelling to destinations of their choice.

All staff was invited to board our special flight with their passports and air tickets at the start of the day. They were then led by the Student Stewards to their seats, and were served with treats as they enjoyed the in-flight entertainment programme put up by the students.

After the plane landed, all staff was invited to enjoy a tasty reception at the Star Lounge before being brought to their “holiday destinations” by the Class Leaders. Students decorated their classrooms to fit the theme and entertained the teachers with games, performances, videos and many more activities. Certainly, many wonderful and fond memories were created!

The day ended with a sumptuous lunch prepared by the Staff Well Being Committee where all staff enjoyed a hearty meal and bonded over it.

The Symphonic Band performed at the annual Lions Club of Singapore Mid-Autumn Festival Celebrations on 12th September. They serenaded the beneficiaries with several songs such as Teresa Teng’s ‘Moonlight Represents My Heart’ and the Bee Gees’ ‘How Deep Is Your Love’. It was a meaningful evening where our students could serve the community through their music.
