As part of the school’s efforts to enhance students’ learning experiences in Character and Citizenship Education (CCE), all Secondary 1 students were given the opportunity to be a part of the Bicentennial Experience on Friday 5 July 2019. The Singapore Bicentennial is a commemoration of the arrival of Stamford Raffles in Singapore. It is a prequel to SG50, and an opportunity for us to look at our longer history.
