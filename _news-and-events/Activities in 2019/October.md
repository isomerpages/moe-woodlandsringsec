In the week after the End-of-Year Examinations, the mood amongst the student body was naturally relaxed. Learning continued though, taking on a different mode as they were treated to outdoor activities, exhibitions from external organisations as well as the Taster Modules for the Secondary 2 cohort.

Dragon boating was conducted for our Secondary 1 students at Kallang Basin on Monday, 21 October 2019. This sport involves 20 participants who will need to co-ordinate their paddling to achieve a common goal. It was a good opportunity for the students to bond while they built teamwork. This meaningful activity is aligned with MOE’s Sports Education Programme (SEP) which aims to advocate the importance of sports education. The school seeks to cater for development of skills and sports knowledge of students and help to promote active participation in sports among our students.

The Maritime Port Authorities (MPA) was also invited to send their MPA Maritime Bus to our school to be exhibited throughout the week, and present a show during assembly. This special exhibition showcases the history of Singapore’s maritime trade and its importance to Singapore today.<br><br><img src="/images/19octcaptionleft.jpg" style="width:45%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The students were also taught some financial literacy through a guided game conducted by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board over the week. Appropriately named ‘Game On!’, it is the CPF’s outreach programme designed for secondary school students.

2020 is an important year for our Secondary 2 students. Before they start the new year, decisions are to be made in terms of subject combination. To help them make informed choices, teachers conducted Taster Modules which included talks and demonstrations, to introduce the students to subjects they will be taking at the national examinations.

Organised by Ministry of Education (Curriculum and Planning Development Division) and hosted by Ngee Ann Polytechnic, the seminar’s objectives are  
* to provide opportunities for Secondary 3 Electronics students from different schools to interact and work in teams,  
* to create awareness of further studies and career in electronics, and  
* to expose students to programmable devices.

At the seminar, participants learned how to use programmable devices to design simple electronics applications. Participants explored the use of block programming to design a lighting sequence. They also got to see how a practical lesson in Industrial Automation (in the Mechatronics course) was conducted. There was also a tour of Ngee Ann Polytechnic’s Aerospace Hub where students got to experience flight simulation.

The last day of the school year, also known as Technically Normal Day (TND) in Woodlands Ring Secondary, would traditionally end with a concert organised by the students from the Secondary 3NT level. For TND 2019, the whole school came together in the hall to celebrate achievements and progress made over the year – not merely with certificates, but also with music, songs, dance, rap and video montage! It was indeed a joyful celebration to end off our school year on a high note!

##### **Humanities Learning Journey @ WRSS Post-Exam Week**

The Humanities Department at Woodlands Ring Secondary School (WRSS) values experiential and authentic learning. We leverage on learning journeys (LJ) to complement our Humanities curriculum during the post-exam activities in October.<br><br><img src="/images/19octcaptionleft2.jpg" style="width:45%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

<br><br>
Our Secondary 3 Elective History students visited the ReUnion exhibition at the National Museum of Singapore. We had representatives from the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute to guide our students around the exhibition. Students had fun trying to solve the bingo puzzle while learning more about the history of the labour movement in Singapore.

To better engage our students in their learning of plate tectonics through various exhibits and visual stimulators, our Secondary 3 Elective Geography students were taken to the Science Centre. There, they experienced how the type of soil and structural features in buildings exacerbate the shaking caused by an earthquake. Through interactive exhibits, the students also learn about the impacts of climate change on Singapore.
		 
Our Secondary 3 Normal Technical students offering the subject Elements of Business Skills (EBS) went for a one-day Service Industries LJ. This outing provided an opportunity for our students to understand how businesses in the retail, hospitality and travel and tourism industries operate. During the LJ, our students had to make observations and interact with the staff to find out about the marketing mix and customer service strategies the businesses use to attract customers.

All in, it was a laboriously fun afternoon for the various student groups from WRSS as they witness their textbook learning coming to life!

##### **APS Fusion Fiesta**

<img src="/images/19oct21.jpg" style="width:45%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">
On 30th October 2019, our students, Chiw Wen Zhe Darius (Class 2-1), Fariha Iyshah Binte Mohammed Fauzi (Class 2-2) and Abdul Hadi Bin Abdul Rasid (Class 2-4) participated in APS Fusion Fiesta ‘Local Flavours’ Baking Competition. The competition was hosted by Assumption Pathway School Baking Practices Department as part of their annual Income OrangeAid APS Challenge. Through this competition, our students gained exposure and out-of-classroom experience to hone their culinary skills in cookie and cake-making. They endeavoured in concocting unique recipes of cookies and cake to prepare a fusion of local flavours that was presented before the judges. Our students expressed their creativity confidently. It was a remarkable learning experience for them to have overcome considerable pressure from 29 other schools and make their mark through resilience to perform at their best in this competition. We are very proud of our students to be awarded the consolation prize for this competition which includes a trophy and food vouchers.
