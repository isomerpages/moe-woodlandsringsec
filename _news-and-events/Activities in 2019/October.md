In the week after the End-of-Year Examinations, the mood amongst the student body was naturally relaxed. Learning continued though, taking on a different mode as they were treated to outdoor activities, exhibitions from external organisations as well as the Taster Modules for the Secondary 2 cohort.

Dragon boating was conducted for our Secondary 1 students at Kallang Basin on Monday, 21 October 2019. This sport involves 20 participants who will need to co-ordinate their paddling to achieve a common goal. It was a good opportunity for the students to bond while they built teamwork. This meaningful activity is aligned with MOE’s Sports Education Programme (SEP) which aims to advocate the importance of sports education. The school seeks to cater for development of skills and sports knowledge of students and help to promote active participation in sports among our students.

The Maritime Port Authorities (MPA) was also invited to send their MPA Maritime Bus to our school to be exhibited throughout the week, and present a show during assembly. This special exhibition showcases the history of Singapore’s maritime trade and its importance to Singapore today.

The students were also taught some financial literacy through a guided game conducted by the Central Provident Fund (CPF) Board over the week. Appropriately named ‘Game On!’, it is the CPF’s outreach programme designed for secondary school students.

2020 is an important year for our Secondary 2 students. Before they start the new year, decisions are to be made in terms of subject combination. To help them make informed choices, teachers conducted Taster Modules which included talks and demonstrations, to introduce the students to subjects they will be taking at the national examinations.
