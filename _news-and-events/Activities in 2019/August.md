Our Chinese Dance Club participated in the 27th World Youth Singapore Golden Lion Award Dance Art Competition. The competition was held on Saturday, 3 August at the Kreta Ayer People’s Theatre. This competition provided a good platform for the girls to showcase their talent and gained knowledge about the Chinese cultures and traditions. The girls competed with participants from China, Brunei and Malaysia. Through their hard work and strong teamwork, we emerged Champion for two consecutive years. Apart from the competition, the girls were inspired by a dance item titled “Live and Learn”, performed by the senior citizens who showed confidence and gracefulness in their moves.

##### **National Day Celebration 2019**

The combined Uniformed Groups cadets trained hard over the past few weeks to deliver an outstanding parade. This year’s parade started differently with the supporting contingents entering the parade square from behind the flag poles, navigating a series of turns before forming up in front of the audience. They symbolise the emerging youths of today who can adapt to the complex and rapidly changing challenges of the future. Morale were high as the cadets wowed the audience with their precisely executed drills. The parade ended with the cadets marching off to the beat of the drums, holding their heads up high as they know that they had just delivered their best parade run.

In conjunction of the commemoration of Singapore Bicentennial that marks the 200th anniversary of Sir Stamford Raffles’ arrival in Singapore, the WRS National Day Concert 2019 took the WRS students and staff through an audio-visual experience of exploring how our past has formed us, appreciating what we have achieved at present, and discovering what it means for our future!

The concert started with the explanation of the National Day theme 2019 – Our Singapore and its logo, by the lively and eloquent emcees. Next, the English Drama Club took us through the history of Singapore through four different scenes that represented the major milestones of Singapore’s development.

Our dancers weaved into the performance seamlessly throughout the time period. Chinese dancers represented how the Chinese immigrants preserved their tradition in performing arts through their elegant dance piece. The Malay dancers performed the piece “Pesta Muda Mudi” to portray the distinctive pop culture during the 1960s. The Modern dancers depicted Singapore working towards an inclusive and caring society, as well as representing the passionate youth with vibrant energy!

Last but not least, we had the most anticipated segment of the concert – Community Singing! The crowd roared to life with the familiar National Day songs that the students and staff had voted the week before. It was made even more exciting when teachers took the mic and led the whole school in singing their favourite National Day songs! The 1.5 hours concert ended on a high! What a wonderful celebration!

##### **Bedazzled 2019**

The Choir, with a strength of 40 members, took part in the B-Dazzled Show Choir Festival 2019. Based on the theme of zombie apocalypse, coming out from the rubbles, the Choir coloured the stage with cartwheels, fanciful dance moves and sang a mashup of Rise Up and People Like Us. Soloists, Uy Alexa Denise Mejia (3E1) and Natalie Tan Meng Shuen (3E4), dazzled the crowd with their amazing voices. The Choir clinched the Platinum award at the festival. The experience had its challenges but it also allowed us to bond a lot more as a team. As Cheryl Ng (3N6) shared, “We learnt a lot and stepped out of our comfort zone. We stepped up our practices and improved a lot. The experience also allowed us to gain a lot more confidence from when we first began. More importantly, we gave our best and left the stage with no regrets.” It was a worthwhile experience for the Choir.

Student members from Robotics Club participated in the International World Robot Games held in Bangkok, Thailand from 30 to 31 August 2019. This international competition promotes a great opportunity for technological creativity among students by stimulating their imagination and embrace innovative technology to complete the given task. Our students participated in the Rugby, Search & Rescue and Sumo events. Through the experience, our students learnt to collaborate with one another in co-constructing knowledge and problem solving by integrating their learning to develop the abilities to design, make and code their robots to solve real-life problems. Our students also had the opportunities to think critically and work autonomously in some instances and to work together with teams from other countries, strengthening their collaborative and social skills. Despite the intense and challenging competition environment, our students had fun competing with their peers from other countries and make as many friends as they could in return. Through their interactions with counterparts, they espoused the three school core values of responsibility, respect and resilience.
