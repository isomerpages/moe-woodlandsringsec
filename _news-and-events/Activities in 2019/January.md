### **January**
##### **Welcome Secondary Ones!**
We welcomed our newest batch of Secondary One students into the Woodlands Ring Secondary School family. Led by our Secondary Four seniors, the Secondary One students went through a series of programmes which gave them a deeper insight about the school. They were also taught the school song, and how to put on a necktie. We are certainly looking forward to create more special memories with our new students!

We welcomed our friends from our twinning school from China, Chengguan Middle School from 28 – 30 January. Students and educators got a glimpse of how we conducted lessons and what life was like for a student in Woodlands Ring Secondary School. Our students also brought our visitors out to view the neighbourhood and visit some attractions around Singapore.
