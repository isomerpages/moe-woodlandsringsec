### **January**
##### **Welcome Secondary Ones!**
We welcomed our newest batch of Secondary One students into the Woodlands Ring Secondary School family. Led by our Secondary Four seniors, the Secondary One students went through a series of programmes which gave them a deeper insight about the school. They were also taught the school song, and how to put on a necktie. We are certainly looking forward to create more special memories with our new students!
