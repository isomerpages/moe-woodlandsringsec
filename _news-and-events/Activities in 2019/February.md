We kicked off the month of February with our annual tradition — Community Morning — where our students fanned out into the neighbourhood to distribute oranges to residents in our community.

We also celebrated Chinese New Year with a mini-concert where students enjoyed performances by our school’s Guzheng Ensemble, Modern Dancers and Chinese Dancers. The school was treated to a dragon and lion dance performance which involved the traditional custom of ‘採青’ (literally meaning “plucking the greens”). The festivities also included a school-wide calligraphy competition whereby students got to try their hand out at writing out traditional couplets and an enjoyable lou-hei session.

This year, we commemorated Total Defence Week with a range of activities. Students got to learn more about the Singapore Police Force’s PETRA (Patrol, Escort, Tactical Response Van) vehicle and its other capabilities. Our uniformed group cadets also organised various activities for the school. Cadets from the National Police Cadet Corps shared on the safe use of Personal Mobility Devices, cadets from the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps gave first-aid lessons while the National Cadet Corps set up a booth showcasing their equipment. Students also got to pledge their commitment to Total Defence through a photo booth.
