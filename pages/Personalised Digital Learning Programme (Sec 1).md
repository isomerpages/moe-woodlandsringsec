<h4><strong>Introduction</strong>&nbsp; </h4>
<p>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020
for all schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD).&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>PLDs in Teaching and Learning</strong></h4>
<p>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national e-learning platform -
the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) - as well as other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also
enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they
navigate an increasingly digitalised world. &nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Choice of PLD in Woodlands Ring Secondary School</strong></h4>
<p>The school is using the iPad 11-inch(A16) (8GB RAM and 64GB) as its choice
for the PLD for all students. The device bundle includes a 4-year warranty
and 4-year insurance for devices purchased through the school in 2026.&nbsp;All
devices will be installed with MOE's prescribed Mobile Device Management
(MDM) system for use in school.</p>

<h4><strong>Personal iPad Policy</strong></h4>
<p>Parents and guardians have the option to provide a personal iPad for their
child to use as their Personal Learning Device (PLD). To ensure the device
is ready for classroom use, all personal iPads must be onboarded onto the
school’s MDM system. This process allows the school to provide necessary
technical support, ensure seamless connectivity to the school’s network,
and automatically deploy required learning applications. Please note that
the MDM is also used to maintain a focused learning environment by managing
access to age-appropriate content during school hours.</p>
<h4><strong>Minimum Hardware Specifications</strong></h4>
<p>To support the necessary software and ensure a smooth learning experience,
the following requirements apply:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Minimum Requirement:</strong> iPad (9th Generation) or newer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Recommended:</strong> iPad (10th Generation) or any current model
of <strong>iPad Air</strong> or <strong>iPad Pro</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Incompatible Models:</strong> Any iPad model older than the 9th
Generation (e.g., iPad 8, iPad Air 2, etc.) is considered non-compatible
as they may not support the latest educational software or security updates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Storage:</strong> A minimum of <strong>64GB</strong> is required
(256GB is recommended for students taking media-heavy subjects).</p>
</li>
</ul>
