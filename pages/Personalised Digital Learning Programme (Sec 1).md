<p><strong><u>Introduction</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) in March 2020
for all schools to help students strengthen their digital literacy.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised
Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby
every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning
Device (PLD).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>PLDs in Teaching and Learning</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>The PLD will be used in tandem with the national elearning platform -
the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) - as well as other educational
technology to personalise and enhance students’ learning. This will also
enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they
navigate an increasingly digitalised world. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Choice of PLD in Woodlands Ring Secondary School</u></strong>&nbsp;
<br>The school is using the iPad 11-inch(A16) (8GB RAM and 64GB) as its choice
for the PLD for all students. The device bundle includes a 3-year warranty
and 3-year insurance.&nbsp;</p>
