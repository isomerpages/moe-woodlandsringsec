<p>Be ready to be dazzled by our very own WRSS Production, “Dreaming of A
Midsummer Night’s Dream”, featuring performances by WRSS students and alumni.</p>
<p>This event is organised in conjunction with our celebration of the school’s
25th anniversary. It is also part of our homecoming event, a great opportunity
for our alumni and former staff to gather and catch up with one another.</p>
<p>Attendees can look forward to performances from seven Co-Curricular Activity
(CCA) groups, some of our very own Alumni and, also enjoy an array of fringe
activities!</p>
<p>For more updates, follow our production Instagram page @wrss_productions_2024!</p>
