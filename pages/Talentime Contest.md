To celebrate youth talent and vibrancy, Woodlands Ring Secondary School and Woodlands Community Centre are collaborating in a quest to search for Woodlands’ most talented youth.

Part of the WRS20! Carnival on 30 June 2018, this talentime contest invites the Woodlands community to join in our school’s celebration of 20 years of nurturing and beyond.

The _So You Think You Have Talent_ platform is created specially for our youths in Woodlands. It is centred on encouraging these young people to showcase their different talents and express their creative voices, so that they will also get the diverse opportunities to learn, collaborate, grow, engage and excite the community.

Talented youths in Woodlands, ages 10 – 20, can take part in the competition as individuals, or by forming teams of no more than 20 members. Upon registration, the individual/group participant(s) should prepare a performance of duration between 3 and 6 minutes, to be submitted for the contest. Participants can choose to display their skills in conventional performing arts such as singing, dancing and acting, or showcase unconventional talents such as juggling, yo-yo and wushu. They are free to use their imagination and be as original as they like.

So You Think You Have Talent @ WRS20! Carnival concluded with a bang on 30 June 2018. There was singing: solo, acapella, pop band; there was dance: K-Pop, Hip-Hop, Popping & Animation; and then there was Pen Tapping. But whatever the art form, the ten finalists performed and gave their all, to enthusiastic encouragement from the large turnout. Through this event, the contestants learned from their respected judges, and from one another, even as they both competed against and made friends with one another. Spirits were high and everyone – aspiring participants, adjudicators and audience alike – was simply soaking in the exuberant atmosphere and enjoying themselves. It was a day to celebrate youth, talent and passion.
