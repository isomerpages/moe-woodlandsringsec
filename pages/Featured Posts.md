<h3>UPDATE ON UPGRADING PLAN FOR WOODLANDS RING SECONDARY SCHOOL</h3>
<p>Woodlands Ring Secondary School was originally due for upgrading at the existing site in Woodlands from January 2023 to December 2024 and that the school was to hold temporarily at the former North View Secondary site at 530 Yishun Ring Road during the upgrading period.</p>
<p>However, in order to minimise inconvenience to our existing students, the start date for the upgrading of Woodlands Ring Secondary will be deferred by two years to coincide with its merger with Fuchun Secondary that would take place in January 2025.</p>
<p>During the upgrading works which would tentatively take two years (from January 2025 to December 2026)<strong>, the merged school will operate from the Fuchun Secondary site at 21 Woodlands Ave 1 S(739062) instead of the former North View Secondary site</strong>. Upon completion of upgrading, the merged school will return to the upgraded Woodlands Ring Secondary site.</p>
<p>The school will continue to operate at its current site until end of 2024. The school together with MOE will ensure that the existing school facilities are well-maintained to provide a conducive learning environment for our students.</p>

Imagine stepping into Elias's house in The Forest. Time seems to be suspended in this space. Half chopped trees with axe hanging dangerously by the side, mushrooms sprouting amidst the grass. Moving forward, you take a glimpse into his dilapidated house and muddy floor. There is no one in the house yet you feel you have intruded into his space, his privacy. <a href="/news-and-events/wrs-in-the-news/vr-into-classroom/">[more]</a>

去年年底假期间，辅廉中学37名同学参加了学校举办海外学习之旅。这次学习之旅包括去上海、平湖以及苏州等地去接触当地的人文文化。在这7天里学生不但有机会见识到中国的科技发展进度，也加深了他们对中国历史文化的认识。<a href="/news-and-events/wrs-in-the-news/chinese/">[more]</a>

<h3>Applied Learning Programme</h3>

<strong>The Robotics Education and Enterprise (TREE)</strong>

The Applied Learning Programme (ALP) provides opportunities for students to discover their strengths and interests, and to find greater relevance and motivation in their learning. They complement the school’s core academic and student development programmes. The ALP helps students appreciate the relevance and value of what they are learning in the academic curriculum to the real world, and develop stronger motivation and purpose to acquire knowledge and skills. The emphasis is on the application of thinking skills, integrating knowledge across subject disciplines, stretching the imagination and applying these in real-world settings in society and industries.

At Woodlands Ring Secondary School (WRSS), our ALP focus area is on Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM). As such, our school offers all Lower Secondary students The Robotics Education and Enterprise (TREE). WRSS is one of the 11 secondary schools to offer ALP in the Robotics domain. It is an approach that emphasises authentic and practice-oriented learning experiences. It also gives students additional opportunities to acquire skills and qualities based on the practical application of knowledge in real-world contexts, and strongly supports our focus on developing 21<sup>st</sup> century competencies and values in our students.

In partnership with STEM Inc., Science Centre Singapore, we have reviewed our ALP to include coding. In 2017, students learn to programme, code and upload to an Arduino microcontroller to perform simple tasks like lighting up an LED or make a buzzer sound, to more complicated tasks such as mimicking a traffic-light system or use infra-red input devices to measure and control output devices. Authentic scenarios are presented to challenge students’ critical and inventive thinking; to test their troubleshooting skills besides learning soft skills such as communicating with team members and learning to make responsible decisions.

Involvement of students in larger project tasks such as designing and prototyping a robot arm to perform precise functions or to make it ‘dance’ to a one-minute music tune, using smartphone to control Robotics arms via Bluetooth, further stretches the students’ imagination and potential to complete the task while living out the school core values of Responsibility, Respect and Resilience.
