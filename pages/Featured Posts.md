<h3>UPDATE ON UPGRADING PLAN FOR WOODLANDS RING SECONDARY SCHOOL</h3>
<p>Woodlands Ring Secondary School was originally due for upgrading at the existing site in Woodlands from January 2023 to December 2024 and that the school was to hold temporarily at the former North View Secondary site at 530 Yishun Ring Road during the upgrading period.</p>
<p>However, in order to minimise inconvenience to our existing students, the start date for the upgrading of Woodlands Ring Secondary will be deferred by two years to coincide with its merger with Fuchun Secondary that would take place in January 2025.</p>
<p>During the upgrading works which would tentatively take two years (from January 2025 to December 2026)<strong>, the merged school will operate from the Fuchun Secondary site at 21 Woodlands Ave 1 S(739062) instead of the former North View Secondary site</strong>. Upon completion of upgrading, the merged school will return to the upgraded Woodlands Ring Secondary site.</p>
<p>The school will continue to operate at its current site until end of 2024. The school together with MOE will ensure that the existing school facilities are well-maintained to provide a conducive learning environment for our students.</p>
