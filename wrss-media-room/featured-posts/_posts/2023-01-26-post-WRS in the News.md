### **Bringing virtual reality into the classroom**

**video not on youtube**

Imagine stepping into Elias’s house in The Forest. Time seems to be suspended in this space. Half chopped trees with axe hanging dangerously by the side, mushrooms sprouting amidst the grass. Moving forward, you take a glimpse into his dilapidated house and muddy floor. There is no one in the house yet you feel you have intruded into his space, his privacy.

Welcome into this immersive world where you can simply create anything out from your imagination. From little huts in _Fiela’s Child_ to virtual head sculptures that display different emotions.  In the classroom, students create their own immersive space.  You see students waving their motion controllers to create designs and images. Excited chatters are often heard.  At times, there are sounds of awe and fascination.

Such is the description of one of Miss Deborah Ong’s Art classes.

Miss Deborah Ong, an Art and English Literature teacher has introduced Virtual Reality into Woodlands Ring Secondary School. Her use of VR has also extended to her Literature lesson where she asked her Secondary Three students to create the setting where Fiela lives from the text, _Field’s Child_ .

Miss Ong’s project was one of the exhibitors for the  International Conference on Teaching and Learning with Technology (iCTLT) 2018. Please click on the link for more information on her VR project.
