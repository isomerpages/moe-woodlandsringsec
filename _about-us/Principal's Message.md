<h3><strong>Principal’s message</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<h4><em>Woodlands Ring Secondary School: </em><br><em>A School of Opportunities, A New Beginning</em></h4>
</blockquote>
<p>It is my honour and privilege to lead Woodlands Ring Secondary School
(WRSS), a merged school that brings together the rich legacies of Fuchun
Secondary School and Woodlands Ring Secondary School. I am deeply grateful
to my predecessors, Mr Shawal Bin Hussin and Mrs Ng Siew Bee, for laying
the strong foundations that continue to guide our school’s growth and development.</p>
<p>Guided by our new motto, <strong><em>Forward with Wisdom</em></strong>,
WRSS is committed to nurturing <strong>forward-looking, compassionate, wise and resilient leaders</strong>.
We believe that the secondary school years are a pivotal period for students
to discover who they are, develop strong values, and build the skills and
confidence needed for the future. Our mission, <strong><em>Empowering every student to grow and lead with purpose and values</em></strong>,
reflects our commitment to holistic education and student development.</p>
<p>Our school culture is anchored in <strong>We RISE² — Respect, Integrity, Selflessness, Empathy and Excellence</strong>.
These values shape how we learn, interact and contribute as a community,
guiding both our decisions and daily actions.</p>
<p>At WRSS, learning is purposeful, values-centred and future-focused. Our
Applied Learning Programme (ALP), themed <em>The Future of Transportation</em>,
engages students in real-world problem-solving through technology and coding,
nurturing innovation and critical thinking. Complementing this is our 3C
Programme — <em>Connect, Collaborate, Create</em> — which adopts an interdisciplinary
approach to deepen learning while fostering creativity and collaboration.</p>
<p>Recognising that every student is unique, we provide diverse learning
pathways and enrichment opportunities to support students’ interests, talents
and aspirations. Our talent development programmes, leadership platforms
and co-curricular experiences are designed to help students grow in confidence,
resilience and responsibility.</p>
<p>We believe that <strong>every student is a leader</strong>. Through our
Learning for Life Programme, anchored in <em>The Leadership Challenge</em> framework,
students are guided to lead with integrity, serve others selflessly, and
contribute meaningfully to society.</p>
<p>Together with our dedicated educators and valued partners, we work as
one community to nurture learners who grow with wisdom, lead with purpose,
and rise to the challenges of the future.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s to a forward-looking and radiant future together.</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mr Lam Yui Png</strong>
<br>Principal</p>
