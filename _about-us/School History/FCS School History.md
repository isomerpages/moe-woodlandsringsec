<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1986: Humble Beginning&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Always
Learning, Always Growing”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;img src="/images/history1.png"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Fuchun started on 2nd January 1986 with 9 teachers and a student
population of 109. The responsibility of establishing a mission and an
identity for the school rested squarely on the shoulders of the pioneer
principal, Mrs Ngiam Geak Kim and her staff of nine teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Mission&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;To develop
each student to his or her fullest potential, producing an educated and
caring individual who is adaptable and innovative with a zest for living
a full, productive and spiritually meaningful life, contributing much to
the well-being of Singapore and giving loyal service to the country&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Crest&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school crest
is designed in a stylised ‘F’ to represent the name of the school and the
flame of the truth. The three little steps beside the flame signify that
truth is not always easy to express and must therefore be taken “step-by-step”.
The red colour of the crest symbolizes courage to uphold the school motto
“&lt;strong&gt;TRUE TO SELF&lt;/strong&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Motto&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school motto
‘True to Self’ urges students to imbibe the qualities of honesty and moral
integrity. It is an expression of the one true quality that governs the
students’ behavior in all aspects of school life and beyond. To develop
caring and responsible leaders of tomorrow, our students must be truthful
and upright citizens.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Vision&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school vision
was ‘Always Learning and Always Growing’.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1990-1995&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“IT
for the first time in teaching”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;img src="/images/history2.png"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1991&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fuchun set up the
first Lower Secondary Macintosh laboratory. Teachers used IT for the first
time in teaching Mathematics. Students went through an IT programme where
they learned to use MacDraw, Word and Excel programmes.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1992&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fuchun was placed
second for value-addedness in the Special/Express stream among 139 secondary
schools in the first ranking of schools by the Ministry of Education.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Fuchun participated for the first time in the Singapore Youth
Festival with a mass dance by the Lower Secondary girls. They also performed
at the National Day Celebrations.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;The first school newsletter, the Fuchun News was produced and
circulated in January.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1993&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fuchun students made
a special delivery to their cherished teacher and Vice-Principal Miss Aileen
Lau, who was battling cancer. This inspired her to write the poem ‘One
Thousand Paper Cranes’ that was later published in her collection of poems
‘Face to Faith’ and recited on a programme.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One Thousand Paper
Cranes&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;By Miss Aileen Lau&lt;br&gt;One thousand
paper cranes&lt;br&gt;You said the class would make.&lt;br&gt;I smiled
at your earnestness.&lt;br&gt;“That’s the number for good luck&lt;br&gt;According
to a Japanese legend,”&lt;br&gt;You piped on:&lt;br&gt;“And cranes symbolise
long life.”&lt;br&gt;That touched me to the core –&lt;br&gt;Having been
twice struck by cancer.&lt;br&gt;“We will make you one thousand cranes!”&lt;br&gt;“You
will get better,”&lt;br&gt;You promised with all your might.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;At home recuperating, I imagine&lt;br&gt;All
forty-two pairs of hands busy&lt;br&gt;Manly hands cutting tiny squares
of colour&lt;br&gt;Under the dark brown desks&lt;br&gt;While heads look
up in attention&lt;br&gt;And gentle caring feminine fingers&lt;br&gt;Folding
each square intricately&lt;br&gt;To form the delicate crane&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;A visit for Teachers’ Day&lt;br&gt;And
I’m given a big yellow bag.&lt;br&gt;Opening it I find&lt;br&gt;One thousand
tiny colourful paper cranes.&lt;br&gt;My eyes filled with tears&lt;br&gt;You
kept your promise.&lt;br&gt;My heart bursts with hope&lt;br&gt;I will get
better.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Fuchun and Mrs Ngiam were featured in the maiden issue of the
‘Care Connection’, a newsletter published by the Pastoral Care and Career
Guidance Section of the Ministry of Education. The article had a headline
that read “You are loved at Fuchun”, which described Fuchun as a ‘typical
neighbourhood school’ where pupils were fortunate to be ‘cherished by the
principal, teachers and schoolmates’.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1994&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;There were many improvements
in the teaching facilities. Each classroom was installed with a television
and a video-cassette recorder.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;In April, the school mourned the loss of her Vice-Principal,
Miss Aileen Lau, who succumbed to cancer. An English and Literature teacher,
she had a distinguished teaching and research career. In 1993, she was
awarded the National Day Efficiency Medal. Today we remember her for her
unceasing efforts and great commitment in teaching the students of Fuchun.
We commemorate this exceptional teacher by awarding annually the Aileen
Lau Book Prize to students who demonstrate a commendable love for reading.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1995&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;This was the year
when the school initiated work experience for our students. A group of
Secondary Three students worked with the Singapore Zoological Gardens during
the November holidays. Since then, our students have had the opportunity
to be involved in work experience at Baxter Healthcare Private Limited.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1996-1999&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“The
Most Improved Neighbourhood School”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1996&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school bade farewell
to Mrs Ngiam, who joined East Secondary school and welcomed Mr Johari Mohd
Rais as the new principal.&amp;nbsp;Fuchun had the distinction of being
awarded the title of “The Most Improved Neighbourhood School” in .&amp;nbsp;A
booming student population made it necessary for the school to function
in two sessions for the first time.&amp;nbsp;The school also celebrated
her 10th anniversary with the staging of the dance drama entitled “Kojiki”.
The dance movements of Kojiki mirrored the life of students in Fuchun.
The movements symbolized the periods of harmony and discord, similar to
the episodes of struggles and conflicts students experience in pursuit
of their goals.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1997&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The piling work for
the extension block began in August 1997 and construction began in December
that year.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1998&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The extension building
was completed in November 1998. The extension block boasts 2 full computer
labs, 3 IT-enabled rooms, 9 classrooms, 6 special rooms and 3 CCA rooms.
The extension block provides the necessary infrastructure support to manage
and use of IT for enhancing students’ knowledge, skills and experience.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1999&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school went on
a single session in January 1999 with a total of 38 classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Millenium (2000-2005)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Leaders.
Learners. Explorers”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;img src="/images/history3.png"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2001&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The first annual school
magazine was produced to chronicle the aspirations and endeavours of the
school. The year also marked the official opening of the Performing Arts
Studio by SAC Chairman, Mr Phillip Lee.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2002&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school bade farewell
to Mr Johari Mohd Rais and welcomed Mrs Chuah-Koh Eng Ngoh as the new principal.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Fuchun Concert Band performed at the Victoria Concert Hall on
presenting Fuchun Symphonica II.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2003&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fuchun Student Creed
was initiated and introduced to the school. This Creed was conceptualized
by the student leaders and refined by the teachers.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Student Creed&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;We
are Fuchun students, special and unique.&lt;br&gt;We are compassionate,
caring and upright.&lt;br&gt;We respect others and myself.&lt;br&gt;We
are diligent and seek to excel.&lt;br&gt;We are loyal to our school and
nation.&lt;br&gt;We are Fuchun students and this is our Creed.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2004&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school launched
the CDP (Character Development Programme).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;The programme aims to develop our students into ‘’ students who
are well-rounded individuals with high self-esteem. ‘STAR’ students are
good team players who seek to bring out the best in others. They are good
leaders grounded in strong values and are committed to the society and
nation. They are excellent role models and are the best that they can be.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;It is a 4/5-year programme and there are 5 main areas : Leadership,
Citizenship, Lifeskills, Service &amp;amp; Co-curricular Activities.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Logo&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The figure of
a student on the left becomes the figure of a ‘STAR’ student on the right.
A bold and bright star is emblazoned in the heart of this ‘STAR’ student
and represents the ‘STAR’ qualities in the Character Development Programme.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2005&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;School Vision: A Learner,
A Leader, An Explorer&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Mission: To bring out the best in our students and nurture them
to become individuals with integrity, a passion for learning, a spirit
of innovation and compassion for others in the pursuit of excellence.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;School Values: I CARE Integrity, Camaraderie, Adaptability, Responsibility
and Excellence&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2006&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school celebrated
its 20th anniversary entitled ‘Celebrating our STARS’ which is a fitting
tribute to the school leaders, staff, students, members of our school advisory
committee and partners for their unwavering support.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2007&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The Mother Tongue
Department embarked on a Cultural Immersion Programme, as part of the school’s
Twinning Programme, to Zhongde School in Beijing City, China. It aims to
promote mutual sharing and quality interaction between the two schools
and two cultures.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;The school bade farewell to Mrs Chuah-Koh Eng Ngoh and welcomed
Miss Ranjit Kaur Dhaliwal to take over the helm.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;The school achieved the Sustained Achievement Award (Sports).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2008&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The school focussed
greatly on student and staff development. As part of holistic development
and experiential learning of students, the Humanities and Physical Education
departments embarked on a Cultural Exchange Programme to Perth Australia.
Likewise, the English and Science Departments collaborated on an inaugural
trip to the United Kingdom (UK), opening a new horizon where learning takes
place beyond the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;As part of the school's effort to build staff capacity, the HOD
PE/CCA went on a ten-week enhanced Professional Development Leave. The
enriching learning experience and insights he gained from his educational
journey has helped him to develop a greater understanding and confidence
in carrying out interesting and exciting programmes for the holistic development
of students.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Mdm Elizabeth Wen Kai Fong, LH/English attended a programme on
Management and Leadership in schools (MLS) at the National Institute of
Education.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;The school was awarded the Sustained Achievement Award for SPORTS
(2nd Award).&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2009&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;THE SCHOOL’S NICHE IS IN THE PERFORMING ARTS.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;The school attained remarkable achievements in the following
areas:&lt;/p&gt;</p>

Award for the SEC's Schools' Green Audit Award yet again as well as the
Gold Award for the NEA 3R Awards. Another proud moment was winning the
North West Community Development Council(NWCDC) Outstanding Partner Bronze
Award.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2014&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;The school achieved
the highest honour of the Schools Green Audit - Lotus Sustained Achievement
Award and the Singapore Environment Achievement Award. Fuchun continues
to actualize the aspiration of an environmentally caring school. 2014 was
also a proud phase in Fuchun's life as we gave birth to its first mascot,
EON, on 17th January.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;img src="/images/history4.jpg" style="width: 45%;"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2015&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fuchun received the
Excellent Service Award(EXSA). In addition, it also won the North West
CDC Outstanding School Partner Silver Award.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2016&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;Fuchun celebrated
its 30th Anniversary, aptly themed 'A Distinguished Past, A Distinctive
Future.' We also danced our way into the Singapore Book of Records for
the longest duration of Zumba. 234 students and teachers danced away for
4 hours to our very own Fuchun Dance routines.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;img src="/images/history5.jpg"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;Under the tier 2 ALP,
the school participated in the Singapore Maker Extravaganza at Science
Centre Singapore on 22 and 23 July 2017. The robot booth manned by our
students was highlighted by Straits Times online, titled "It is far more
valuable today to create and make things than just be a consumer" on 22
July.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;img src="/images/history6.jpg"&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt;Fuchun was also awarded the NWCDC Outstanding School Partner
Gold Award for its extensive involvement in programs organised by the NWCDC.
It was a proud year as our green efforts led to the achievement of the
Bronze North West Green Living Award 2017. This award is given to the top
3 schools in the nation who have demonstrated dedication to the green effort
through Green programs in their schools.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
